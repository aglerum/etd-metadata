         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In this dissertation, I explore different types of applications in the area of applied
            machine learning, time series analysis, and prediction. Time series forecasting is
            a fundamental task in machine learning and data mining. It is an active area of research,
            especially in applications that have direct impact on the real world. Foot traffic
            forecasting is one such application, which has a direct impact on businesses and non-profits
            alike. An accurate foot traffic prediction system can help retail businesses, physical
            stores, and restaurants optimize their labor schedule and costs, and reduce food wastage.
            In this work, we design a large scale data collection and prediction system for store
            foot traffic. We propose and compare different prediction models for foot traffic
            forecasting. Our foot traffic data has been collected from wireless access points
            deployed at over 65 businesses across the United States, for more than one year. We
            validate our work by comparing to state-of-the-art time series forecasting approaches.
            Results show the competitiveness of our proposed method in comparison to our previous
            work and state-of-the-art procedures for time series forecasting. Another challenging
            task in the area of time series forecasting is financial time series forecasting.
            As another part of my dissertation, I present a deep learning system for stock price
            prediction, which uses a variety of data for a subset of the stocks on the NASDAQ
            exchange to forecast the stock price. The prediction model is trained on the minutely
            data for a specific stock ticker and predicts the closing price of that stock ticker
            for multi-step-ahead. Our deep learning framework consists of a Variational Autoencoder
            for removing noise and uses time-series data engineering to combine the higher-level
            features with the original features. This new set of features is fed to a Stacked
            LSTM Autoencoder for multi-step-ahead prediction of the stock closing price. Besides,
            this prediction is used by a profit-maximization strategy to provide advice on the
            appropriate time for buying and selling a specific stock. Results show that the proposed
            framework outperforms the state-of-the-art time series forecasting approaches with
            respect to predictive accuracy and profitability. In the second part of my work, we
            present a web-based tool for automatic recoloring of web pages. Automatic application
            of different color palettes to web pages is essential for both professional and amateur
            web designers. However, existing recoloring tools for images and web pages do not
            provide full recoloring. We replace colors in .css, .html, and .svg files, and recolor
            images such as logos, banners, and background tiles to recolor web pages entirely.
            The new color theme is based on a color guide image provided by the user. The evaluation
            shows a high level of satisfaction with the quality of palettes and results of recoloring.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Demand for electrical power is increasing around the globe to keep up with the ever-increasing
            annual load growth, which in turn requires new power sources to be installed. As a
            society, there is a greater emphasis for power sources to be environmentally friendly,
            such as wind and solar. For large-scale wind and solar power sources, electric utilities
            need to install them in the optimal regions which are generally far away from the
            load centers. Hence, efficient and high capacity power transmission solutions are
            required to integrate these energy sources into the power grid. Another new trend
            of electrifying the transportation sector with electric ships and aircrafts requires
            compact electric power devices with high volumetric and gravimetric power densities.
            Therefore, electric utilities and the transportation sector have been exploring innovative
            solutions for energy efficient and high-power density technology options, which include
            utilizing superconducting power devices. High temperature superconducting (HTS) power
            cables and other devices have been developed and installed in several countries around
            the world to achieve more efficient and significantly compact devices compared to
            their copper counterparts. A long-term vision for the future power transmission is
            a cross-country multi-terminal DC HTS cable transmission system. Gas-cooled HTS power
            cables are being explored for electric transportation applications, including aircrafts
            and ships, due to asphyxiation risks associated with liquid nitrogen. Use of a gas
            as the cryogen instead of a liquid, however, poses technical challenges resulting
            from the reduced heat capacity and lower dielectric strength which could affect the
            overall performance of HTS cables. When helium gas is used as the cryogen in HTS power
            devices, the electrical insulation method and materials utilized for liquid nitrogen
            cooled HTS cables are not applicable. For liquid nitrogen cooled HTS power cables
            for electric utility applications, lapped tape insulation has been used to achieve
            operating voltages in excess of 100 kV. When this same design is utilized for electrical
            insulation system of helium gas cooled HTS cables, partial discharge (PD) occurs at
            voltages &lt;10 kV, limiting the operational voltages. The butt gaps within the lapped
            tape insulation layers trap helium gas and cause the associated field enhancements
            leading to low partial discharge inception voltages. The research described in this
            dissertation focused on extending the understanding the technology challenges associated
            with the use of gas media as part of the electrical insulation system at cryogenic
            temperatures. The emphasis was on the development of the concept of superconducting
            gas insulated line (S-GIL) as an alternative to lapped tape electrical insulation
            system to HTS power cables to enable higher operating voltages for helium gas cooled
            HTS power cables. The S GIL, which is similar to the Gas Insulated Line (GIL), was
            conceptualized recently at Florida State University’s Center for Advanced Power Systems
            (FSU-CAPS). The S-GIL utilizes the flow of pressurized cryogenic gas instead of stagnant
            room temperature gas for GIL. The S-GIL addresses the challenge of low partial discharge
            inception voltages (PDIV) in lapped tape insulated, gas cooled HTS cables by eliminating
            the need for solid insulation layers on the cable. However, the need to maintain the
            cable on the axis of the cryostat imposes the requirement of insulator spacers. This
            work explored bundled tubular spacers for S-GIL as an option for spacers and 1-m long
            prototype cables were fabricated and characterized in gaseous helium and helium-based
            gas mixtures. Surface flashover along the surface of the spacers is expected to be
            one of the design factors which influences the voltage rating for S-GIL. The designs
            considered different tube materials and gases and a variety of experiments were conducted
            at room temperature and at cryogenic temperatures to gain a thorough understanding
            of the S-GIL design limitations. To gain further understanding of the limits of the
            S-GIL concept, the design was tested with liquid nitrogen as the insulation medium
            to decipher the role of the intrinsic dielectric strength of the insulation medium.
            Besides providing additional insights into S-GIL concept, the liquid cooled alternative
            will have applications in terrestrial power systems and transportation sector where
            higher operating voltages and efficient thermal designs are needed. The research also
            focused on investigating the surface flashover phenomenon in GHe environment. This
            included investigating the triple point where the conductor, solid insulation material,
            and gas insulation media meet. Surface flashover measurements were performed with
            varying gas density, temperature, gas composition, solid insulation material, applied
            voltage waveform, and electric field strength and distribution.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Active flow control (AFC) has the potential for substantial performance gains and
            meeting the challenges of next-generation high-lift aircraft. High-lift wings employ
            multi-element trailing edge flaps during takeoff and landing. When the aircraft is
            at cruise speed, these flaps are not required and are retracted to reduce drag. These
            aircraft wings with high-lift mechanisms enhance the lift characteristics at slower
            speeds, but suffer due to the added weight of these deployment/retraction mechanisms.
            In the present study, we have investigated the effect of active flow control using
            microjets to enhance the performance of a two-dimensional high-lift supercritical
            airfoil with a simply hinged flap. The airfoil used in the study is the NASA Energy
            Efficient Transport (EET) and the wind-tunnel tests were conducted at a freestream
            velocity of 20 m/s. Two different scaled models were used corresponding to Reynolds
            numbers of 1.3 x 105 and 3.4 x 105. The experiments pertaining to the small scaled
            model were carried out with two angles of incidence of 0° and 4° at a constant flap
            deflection of 20°. For the large scale model, a constant angle of incidence of 0°
            and flap deflection angles of 20° and 30° were investigated. A range of microjet momentum
            ratios and microjet orientations were studied for both models. Particle Image Velocimetry
            was carried out to study the mean velocity field and the effect of microjet control
            at the flap region of the airfoil. For the first model, the baseline flow at both
            the angles of incidence separates at the hinge line and remain separated over the
            entire flap region. The size of the re-circulation region is found to gradually decrease
            with an increase in microjet momentum ratio. Microjets oriented normal to the airfoil
            surface were relatively more effective and successful in re-attaching the flow over
            the entire airfoil at both the angles of incidence. Experiments for the second model
            consisted of both Planar and Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry. The baseline
            flow is separated over a third of the flap at 20° and over the entire flap at 30°.
            Microjets oriented at a more tangential angle are able to completely re-attach the
            flow at both flap angles. In general, active flow control using high-momentum microjets
            was very effective in eliminating/reducing flow separation, however, its effectiveness
            was dependent on the geometric and flow parameters.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Hardbottom habitats in the Big Bend Region of the Gulf of Mexico are the foundation
            for structure-forming species, such as corals and sponges. These structure forming
            communities (SFC) provide important ecological services; they serve as spawning grounds,
            feeding grounds, and as refugia and nurseries for a diverse complex of seasonally
            and ontogenetically mobile fish and invertebrate species, many of which are important
            contributors to commercial and recreational fisheries. Knowledge of the extent of
            such hardbottom communities is an important tool for monitoring species recruitment
            success, stock assessments, and protection from over-exploitation. Modelling techniques
            can be used to evaluate the habitat suitability for SFC within this region, as well
            as elucidate the main factors driving the measure of suitability. The Big Bend Region
            is understudied, lacking comprehensive data on species and community presence. Using
            presence data for six abundant and long-lived taxa (2 stony corals, 3 sponges, and
            gorgonians), a habitat suitability model was constructed with the presence-only modelling
            technique Maxent, to describe the suitability of habitat for SFC in the Big Bend Region.
            Presence records were collected from in-situ surveys of suspected hardbottom habitat
            outside of Apalachicola Bay and from the 2010-2014 NOAA Fisheries reef fish surveys
            for the same region. Records were correlated with environmental covariates and compared
            against randomly sampled faux-absence points to test their effects on habitat suitability.
            Results of the model predicts that over 944 km2 of suitable habitat area exists between
            Port St. Joe and St. Marks. The model exceeded random performance, and found that
            northward current velocity, salinity, terrain type, and depth are the most important
            variables contributing to SFC habitat. Knowledge regarding the extent of these communities
            can elucidate factors that influence the fitness of fish species in the GOM, and ultimately
            inform species management.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Sustainability is a broad concept that encompasses social, economical and environmental
            aspects. Many countries around the world have recently adopted this concept due to
            the worldwide concern that human behavior is causing long-term harm not only to the
            environment but also to human health. This study investigates the current status of
            sustainability, focusing on both enhancing human wellbeing and protecting the environment,
            from the viewpoints of architects and interior design practitioners within Saudi Arabia.
            The objective of this study was to identify possible barriers, attitudes, and perceptions
            regarding sustainable development of professionals who are incorporating these practices
            within their projects. The information gathered in this study was obtained through
            related professional article and journals and was reinforced with knowledge gained
            from interviews conducted with practitioners who have worked on sustainable projects
            within Saudi Arabia. The results of the study indicated that the application of sustainability
            principles in Saudi Arabia commercial building projects is currently limited in both
            scope and size. The practitioners interviewed for this study displayed overall positive
            attitudes toward sustainability practices. There was a lack of knowledge and attention
            paid to the importance of the human wellness principles that are also a part of sustainability,
            however. Moreover, participants identified economic, educational, and governmental
            hurdles that influence and suppress sustainable development in Saudi Arabia. Due to
            these hurdles, the degree of sustainability application is inconsistent in regions
            across the country. Potential implications regarding economic, social and environmental
            aspects are detailed and potential solutions that would accelerate sustainable development
            in the country are identified.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Overwhelming evidence demonstrates exercising regularly decreases the risk for clinical
            diseases. One possible explanation for the low exercise adherence rates is the perceptual-cognitive-affective
            responses that accompany the exercise experience. The dynamics by which these psychological
            states change as a function of physical effort and related physiological responses
            have been addressed separately in various conceptual frameworks. Yet, the previous
            integrative model neglects the crucial role of motivation to adhere and the disposition
            of exertion tolerance (ET), factors that influence and are influenced by perceived
            and sustained effort. The purpose of the current study is to expand the scope of the
            integrated cognitive-perceptual-affective conceptual framework with the motivation
            to adhere to effort, for the duration of two physical tasks, and when accounting for
            ET. Thirty male participants performed a constant power cycling test and isometric
            handgrip test to assess the progression of the rate of perceived exertion, attentional
            focus, affect, motivation to adhere, and felt arousal along a parallel increase in
            physiological indicators. The ventilatory threshold was used as a reference point
            during the aerobic task, while ET was indicated by handgrip task time-to-voluntary
            exhaustion. Findings indicated significant time effects and linear trends for perceived
            exertion, attentional focus, affect, and felt arousal, but not motivation to adhere
            during the handgrip and cycling tasks. ET played a key role in the integrity of the
            model. Higher ET individuals experienced more positive affective valence and motivation
            to adhere than those with moderate and lower ET. The intended comprehensive model
            is primarily proposed to stimulate new research into the mechanisms of adaptation;
            especially considering clinical populations where future exercise behavior adherence
            is fundamental.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In "Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing", Miranda Fricker offers
            a framework of the ways in which an agent can be wronged in her capacity as a knower.
            According to Fricker, epistemic injustice comes in two interrelated forms: testimonial
            injustice and hermeneutical injustice. Testimonial injustice consists in a hearer
            assigning a "deflated level of credibility" to a speaker's word, owing to a negative
            identity prejudice the hearer holds about the speaker. Hermeneutical injustice is
            purely structural and consists in a speaker's inability (or difficulty) to render
            their experiences intelligible to others. This paper expands on Fricker's view by
            distinguishing between descriptive testimony and prescriptive (moral) testimony. I
            argue that Fricker's view limits itself to cases of descriptive testimony, and therefore
            fails to track wrongs unique to cases of testimonial injustice involving moral claims.
            I go on to define the main harm in dismissing moral claims as moral objectification
            and argue that it wrongs a speaker by treating them as lacking the capacity to reliably
            form moral judgments. This in turn, excludes them from the community of moral agents
            with standing to make demands. To illustrate how this form of testimonial injustice
            has distinct wrong-making features, I discuss Professor Anita Hill's historic testimony
            during Justice Clarence Thomas's 1991 confirmation hearing. Hill's testimony does
            more than offer a report about the sexual harassment she faced while working with
            Justice Thomas. It also evaluates his behavior as wrong and issues a demand on the
            committee members to factor her testimony into their own evaluation of Thomas's character.
            In assigning a credibility deficit to the prescriptive component of Hill's testimony,
            this demand is thwarted and Hill's testimony is denied the appropriate normative force.
            Hill herself is also treated as though she cannot accurately judge the normative content
            of her own experiences. Fricker's framework does not have the machinery to fully capture
            the epistemic injustice perpetrated in cases of moral testimony like Anita Hill's.
            Distinguishing between descriptive vs. prescriptive testimony equips Fricker’s view
            with the tools to track more cases of testimonial injustice and expand on the wrong-making
            features of epistemic injustice. To illustrate how this form of testimonial injustice
            has distinct wrong-making features, I discuss Professor Anita Hill's historic testimony
            during Justice Clarence Thomas's 1991 confirmation hearing. Hill's testimony does
            more than offer a report about the sexual harassment she faced while working with
            Justice Thomas. It also evaluates his behavior as wrong and issues a demand on the
            committee members to factor her testimony into their own evaluation of Thomas's character.

            this demand is thwarted and Hill's testimony is denied the appropriate normative force.
            Hill herself is also treated as though she cannot accurately judge the normative content
            of her own experiences. Fricker's framework does not have the machinery to fully capture
            the epistemic injustice perpetrated in cases of moral testimony like Anita Hill's.
            Distinguishing between descriptive vs. prescriptive testimony equips Fricker’s view
            with the tools to track more cases of testimonial injustice and expand on the wrong-making
            features of epistemic injustice. Chapter one of this paper will outline Fricker’s
            account of epistemic injustice and the cases she uses to illustrate how it is perpetrated
            in linguistic exchange. Chapter two will focus on the distinction between descriptive,
            Fricker-style testimony and prescriptive testimony. I will analyze Anita Hill’s statement
            to the Senate Judiciary Committee in the context of testimonial injustice and isolate
            the morally relevant ways in which it differs from the examples of epistemic injustice
            Fricker’s account offers. Chapter three will explain why it is useful for a theory
            of epistemic injustice to distinguish between testimonies issuing reports and testimonies
            issuing moral judgments that place demands on a hearer. Here I will also consider
            some potential objections Fricker might raise against my view that dismissal of prescriptive
            testimony consists in wrong-making features distinct from those she picks out her
            own framework. Chapter four will outline my concept of moral objectification, a harm
            that results from the discrediting of moral testimony. I will discuss how this concept
            maps on to certain abuse tactics already being discussed within feminist discourse
            out in the world. I conclude by further elucidating the upshot of my proposed distinction
            between prescriptive and descriptive testimony and how it bears on other discussions
            of power-based harm within feminist philosophy more broadly.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>18Ne(α,p)21Na reaction is one of the reactions providing a pathway for breakout from
            the hot CNO cycles to the rp-process in Type I X-ray bursts. The actual conditions
            under which the breakout occurs depend critically on the thermonuclear reaction rate.
            This rate has not been sufficiently determined yet over the temperatures present under
            X-ray burst conditions. We study the direct 18Ne(α,p)21Na reaction with the Array
            for Nuclear Astrophysics and Structure with Exotic Nuclei (ANASEN), using a helium
            gas target and an 18Ne radioactive beam. ANASEN is an active gas target detection
            system that uses tracking of the light reaction products in conjunction with energy
            measurements in Silicon detectors. The position information required for the tracking
            is provided by a Multi-Anode Proportional Counter in combination with the Silicon
            detectors. From the tracking the location of the interaction is obtained, which is
            directly correlated to the energy of the beam particle. While the beam is losing energy
            while traveling in the gas target, a wide range of reaction energies can be measured
            simultaneously and without changing the accelerator parameters. The difficulty of
            this particular experiment lies on the fact that we are trying to detect one single
            proton from the 18Ne(α,p)21Na reaction per event. Proton background is caused by fusion
            evaporation reactions of the 18Ne with the CO2 quenching gas added on the 4He target
            gas. For the first time in the ANASEN setup, we have implemented a cylindrical Ion
            Chamber for coincident heavy-recoil detection, which was successfully used to suppress
            such background events. The 18Ne(α,p)21Na cross section was measured in the context
            of this dissertation. The experiment allows for a determination of the cross section
            down to reaction energies ∼2 MeV in the center-of- mass system. The results are compared
            to the previous (α,p) reaction measurement, as well as to the time-inverse (p,α) reaction
            measurement and theoretically calculated cross sections. Our work resolves significant
            inconsistencies between the experimental information on the 18Ne(α,p) reaction and
            the indirect information available, giving larger credence to the use of such indirect
            methods. At the same time, more sensitive measurements of the 18Ne(α,p) reaction are
            needed to provide experimental information on the reaction energies below 2 MeV, most
            important for the break-out phase of X-ray bursts. The experimental techniques developed
            in this work would have to be applied to a beam of 18Ne with significantly higher
            quality and intensity.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation investigates the overall impact of chemical exposure, health care
            disparities, and current health care issues facing the Appalachian Region of the United
            States while adding to the research of human disease ecology and essential health
            care delivery. Moreover, it is structured as a three-paper model with a thorough exploration
            of theoretical frameworks connected to existing Geography texts. The research sections
            discuss illicit drug use and its effect on sepsis cases, the impact of dioxins and
            other chemicals on low birth weight, and cancer patient survival based on insurance
            status. This dissertation, thus, explores themes of access to health care and toxin
            exposure. Chapter 2 concerns illicit drug use and the resulting complications, such
            as sepsis, which have been increasing in the Appalachian Region for the last 15 years.
            Illicit drug–related sepsis is commonly caused by using contaminated syringes and
            improper injection techniques that can also lead to multiple other health concerns.
            Untreated infections, for instance, may increase the risk of premature mortality.
            Drug-related sepsis cases at the Charleston Area Medical Center in Charleston, West
            Virginia, have risen from 50 cases in 2007 to 252 cases in 2015. This section was
            published in the Cureus Journal of Medical Science. Chapter 3 analyzes dioxins, a
            group of chemical compounds with deleterious health effects, in the same study region.
            “Dioxin” refers to a chemical by-product generated by the manufacture of multiple
            products such as rubber and synthetic plastic (Gibbs, 1997). In the study area, the
            chemical’s production peaked during the 1950s and ended in the early 1970s. The goal
            of this study is to establish whether dioxin or 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDDS)
            affected low birth weight in the county containing the factory during times of high
            production and potential exposure. The study therefore analyzes birth weight data
            from Kanawha County, West Virginia, from 1955 to 1970. This study found a suggestive
            relationship between an increase of dioxin from the production of Agent Orange (2,4,5-T)
            (see Appendix) and an acute increase of low birth weight in Kanawha County, West Virginia
            (P = 0.042). The final Chapter 4, also published in the Cureus Journal of Medical
            Science, studies potential health care disparities in at-risk populations, which are
            poorly understood in the Appalachian Region of the United States. The goal of this
            study is to examine how different types of insurance coverage (i.e., private insurance,
            Medicare under age 65, Medicare age 65 or over, Medicaid, and self-pay) may modify
            cancer survival over time. This study separately analyzes colon cancer, bladder cancer,
            and anal, rectal, and esophageal cancers. Overall this study suggests that insurance
            category did not modify colon cancer survival after controlling for other risk factors.
            In many ways, this dissertation expands the knowledge of health care within the Appalachian
            Region over an extended time frame and thus seeks to explore differing challenges
            using the tools and theoretical frameworks found within the field of Geography.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation is a theoretical and computational examination of electronic properties
            of topological materials, such as topological insulators and Weyl semimetals. Our
            work is motivated by various experimental observations and theoretical predictions
            about the presence of exotic electronic properties and transport phenomena in different
            topological materials. These materials have been a subject of intense research since
            last decade because their low-energy dispersion can be described by Dirac and Weyl
            equations and they are predicted to have many exciting properties of both fundamental
            and practical significance. In this dissertation, we examine theoretical predictions
            and experimental measurements using density functional theory (DFT) based methods
            and using calculations based on a model Hamiltonian. In the first half of this dissertation,
            we present our detailed results for the Weyl semimetal candidate T$_d$-MoTe$_2$ using
            DFT and DFT+U methods while making careful comparison to different experiments in
            order to validate our results. We also address the fate of the Weyl fermions as a
            function of the Hubbard U using both DFT and a model Hamiltonian approach. Moreover,
            from our calculations, we predict that the system could be in close vicinity of a
            Lifshitz transition. Such a prediction can be experimentally verified by means of
            doping or electrostatic gating. In the second half of this dissertation, we present
            our results for the surface and interface states of the prototypical topological insulator
            material Bi$_2$Se$_3$. We study interfaces of the topological insulator with different
            conventional insulators using both DFT and model Hamiltonian calculations and examine
            the fate of the topological states at the interface. Moreover, we predict the occurrence
            of a topological phase transition in the interface geometry from our calculations
            and point towards a few directions where some of these predictions could be verified
            experimentally. We conclude by presenting implications for further work.

            over time. In this work, the efficacy of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) aggregated
            into 3D spheroids (a-hMSC) as a treatment method for ischemic stroke in a rat model
            was assessed. High resolution fast spin echo (FSE) 1H and gradient recalled echo (GRE)
            23Na images were acquired using the 21.1-T, 900-MHz MRI scanner located at the National
            High Magnetic Field Laboratory in order to elucidate evolving volumetric changes as
            a result of a-hMSC versus control treatments following ischemic insult. Significant
            changes were observed in sodium with a-hMSC transplantation, which was supported by
            observed improvement trends in asymmetric behavior. Histology showed the a-hMSC treatment
            decreased astrocytic activity, preserved mature neurons and stimulated migration of
            neuroprogenitor cells differentiating primarily into neurons instead of other cell
            types. The work presented qualifies a-hMSC as a viable candidate for further study
            as an implant to treat ischemic stroke, and further validates 23Na MRI as an efficient
            and sensitive biological metric for evaluating therapeutic efficiency at the cellular
            level.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The work in this dissertation presents a microfluidic method for the quantitative
            measurement of insulin secretion rates and patterns from single pancreatic islets
            of Langerhans. Proper release of insulin from islets is essential for maintaining
            glucose homeostasis. For full efficacy, both the pattern and the amount of hormone
            release are critical. It is therefore important to understand how insulin levels are
            secreted from single islets in both a quantitative fashion and in a manner that resolves
            temporal dynamics. Although several systems have been described for high time resolution
            measurements, many are limited in their ability to quantify release. Previous microfluidic
            systems for single islet hormone secretion measurements used pressure-driven perfusion
            systems to deliver glucose solutions to an islet chamber and sampled secretions by
            electroosmotic flow (EOF). Because of a discrepancy in these flow rates, only a small
            fraction of the secretions was sampled. Experimental variables, such as islet proximity
            to the sampling channel, can alter that percentage, hindering islet-to-islet comparisons
            of insulin measurements. Using finite element analysis, a microfluidic system was
            designed that ensured cellular secretions were homogenized (RSDs &lt; 3%) prior to sampling,
            permitting quantitative monitoring of insulin and examination of inter-islet biological
            variability. Using the new design, the system was tested with standard insulin solutions
            and demonstrated RSDs of &lt; 2% as well as a detection limit of 10 nM insulin, low enough
            for single islet sampling. The application of this system to monitor insulin release
            from murine islets demonstrated biphasic secretory rates and dynamics that were in
            good agreement with other reports. Single islets from healthy and T2DM human donors
            were also sampled, and with this system, blunted phase 1 peaks and lower secretion
            rates were quantified in the diseased samples compared with the healthy donor samples.
            Chronically elevated levels of lipids have been associated with insulin resistance
            and impaired insulin secretion. Using this quantitative microfluidic system, the acute
            and chronic effects of two classes of lipids were investigated: palmitic acid, a free
            fatty acid (FFA), and 5-palmitic acid hydroxy stearic acid (5-PAHSA), which is a member
            of the novel fatty acid hydroxy fatty acid (FAHFA) class of lipids that are upregulated
            in non-diabetic individuals. Acute exposure of these two classes of lipids to islets
            induced elevated secretion rates, consistent with published reports. Chronic incubation
            (48-h) with 5-PAHSA significantly augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS)
            rates and dynamics at the single islet level compared to chronic incubation without
            the lipid. Incubation in the presence of palmitic acid (PA) resulted in impaired insulin
            release, as characterized by lower release rates and the loss of pulsatility. The
            studies were continued in human islets from both healthy and type 2 diabetes mellitus
            (T2DM)-diagnosed donors. Total amounts of GSIS were not only augmented in islets that
            were chronically incubated with 5-PAHSA, but the dynamic insulin release profiles
            also improved as noted by more pronounced insulin oscillations. With this quantitative
            microfluidic system, the anti-diabetic effects of 5-PAHSA were corroborated by demonstrating
            improved islet function after chronic incubation with this lipid via improved oscillatory
            dynamics along with higher basal and peak release rates. It has been shown that cellular
            stress derived from reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a critical role in the impairment
            and apoptosis of insulin secreting cells. A microfluidic analytical method has been
            developed that permits the simultaneous measurements of real-time oxidative stress
            dynamics with insulin release patterns from single murine islets in vitro. A redox-sensitive
            biosensor (Grx1-roGFP2) was virally delivered to islets of Langerhans and selectively
            expressed in β-cells. The ratiometric fluorescence output of the biosensor was utilized
            to image intracellular ROS dynamics in response to extracellular stimuli, simultaneously
            with insulin release patterns using a microfluidic dual microscopy system. Single
            islets were loaded on the microfluidic device and stimulated with 11 mM glucose while
            ROS and insulin levels were measured simultaneously. The resulting secretory profile
            of insulin was biphasic, in which the first phase response was observed with a duration
            of 5-10 min, followed by second phase oscillations with periods of 3-5 min. The biosensor
            fluorescence also exhibited similar dynamic profiles, with the fluorescence ratio
            rapidly increasing during first phase insulin release and showing pulsatility that
            was synchronized with insulin oscillations in second phase release. Dynamic stimulations
            of infected islets with 20 mM glucose from 11 mM levels also showed a dose-dependent
            response in the redox state of islet β-cells. These results suggest that ROS generation
            is associated with insulin release dynamics and highlight the potential role of ROS
            in insulin release signaling. The experimental method presented here is amenable to
            the quantitative examination of acute changes of other intracellular metabolites simultaneously
            with the release of other hormones.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Prostate cancer is currently a major pubic health issue due to the fact that it is
            the second most common cancer in men with an estimated 174,650 new cases diagnosed
            in 2019. While prostate cancer has a survival rate of nearly 100% for localized cancer
            that number quickly drops once the tumor has metastasized. Treatments for this metastasized
            state have shown varied response based on the phenotype of the tumor. Additionally,
            studies have show that the biomarker used to determine response to treatment, PSA,
            is an inadequate indicator of tumor progression and response to treatment. I propose
            two ODE models of prostate cancer and response to treatment that try to quantify these
            two diculties in treating prostate cancer. In the rst, I model blood vessel formation
            within the tumor to better understand the mechanisms by which PSA is able to leak
            into the blood, and how this may not correlate to tumor burden. I further extend this
            model to the human case where tumor volume is usually unknown. In the second model
            I explore combinations of treatments with androgen deprivation therapy and an immunotherapy
            vaccine. I propose a model of tumor and immune cell dynamics after treatment with
            androgen deprivation therapy. I then include additional treatment with a vaccine.
            With the aid of this model I simulate tumor response to various combinations of treatments,
            and determine an optimal treatment protocol. I also explore how resistance to androgen
            deprivation therapy may aect the ecacy of the vaccine. These models give a better
            understanding of tumor response to treatment. Conclusions from these models can aid
            with optimizing treatment response.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Since the 1940s, conducing has been a mainstay in the undergraduate instrumental music
            education curriculum in the United States. One of the purposes of instrumental conducting
            courses is to prepare students for the occupation of band director after graduation.
            While these courses are offered in most music education degree programs, they often
            mainly focus on baton technique and score study, leaving topics important to the education
            of future band directors out of the curricula. Much of the research on conducting
            class curricula cites one main cause of above- there are many topics to cover in conducting
            class curricula, and simply not enough time to cover them all. Therefore, the purpose
            of this document is to offer focus on topics important to but often left out of the
            conducting class curricula. This supplemental text is divided into three parts, 1)
            verbal communication in rehearsal techniques, 2) nonverbal communication in conducting,
            and 3) technology in the conducting classroom. Each part offers a brief overview of
            the literature on that specific topic, as well as focuses on one, measurable pinpointed
            topic in that area, including teaching verbal communication in rehearsal techniques
            through observation and a systemized methodology for conductor nonverbal communication
            instruction. Resources for implementing pinpointed topics are also provided. The result
            of this document offers multiple ways in which to incorporate each topic into existing
            conducting class curriculum, thus providing a more comprehensive conducting education.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>We propose the use of randomized (scrambled) quasirandom sequences for the purpose
            of providing practical error estimates for quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) applications. One
            popular quasirandom sequence among practitioners is the Halton sequence. However,
            Halton subsequences have correlation problems in their highest dimensions, and so
            using this sequence for high-dimensional integrals dramatically affects the accuracy
            of QMC. Consequently, QMC studies have previously proposed several scrambling methods;
            however, to varying degrees, scrambled versions of Halton sequences still suffer from
            the correlation problem as manifested in two-dimensional projections. This paper proposes
            a modified Halton sequence (MHalton), created using a linear digital scrambling method,
            which finds the optimal multiplier for the Halton sequence in the linear scrambling
            space. In order to generate better uniformity of distributed sequences, we have chosen
            strong MHalton multipliers up to 360 dimensions. The proposed multipliers have been
            tested and proved to be stronger than several sets of multipliers used in other known
            scrambling methods. To compare the quality of our proposed scrambled MHalton sequences
            with others, we have performed several extensive computational tests that use $L_2$-discrepancy
            and high dimensional integration tests. Moreover, we have tested MHalton sequences
            on Mortgage-backed security (MBS), which is one of the most widely used applications
            in finance. We have tested our proposed MHalton sequence numerically and empirically,
            and they show optimal results in QMC applications. These confirm the efficiency and
            safety of our proposed MHalton over scrambling sequences previously used in QMC applications.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Decision-making (DM) efficacy is influenced by several factors including development
            of perceptual-cognitive skills (PCS) that underpin DM processes. In the current study
            I have examined the effect of a “brain-training” method using Neuro-Tracker (i.e.,
            a three-dimensional moving object tracker;3D-MOT) which aimed at improving law enforcement
            officers PCS on decision-making capability. Forty elite law enforcement officers completed
            a pre-posttest experiment on a video based simulated task environment (STE) to establish
            baseline scores for situational awareness, anticipation and DM skills. Participants
            were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (i.e. treatment, active control
            and no-contact). The treatment participants trained on the 3D-MOT over a period of
            three-weeks. The active control read articles and answered questions on the readings
            during that same time period. A no-contact control condition was used to control for
            learning effects on the STE. Pre- and post-testing was scored by five police procedures
            subject-matter-experts. Inspection of the DM Scores shows a descriptive trend where
            by the Passive Control participants showed an average decline in DM Total Score, the
            Active Control participants remained unchanged while the 3D-MOT participants showed
            slight increase. An occlusion paradigm was administered to more closely examine situational
            awareness and anticipation. On average, the participants in the three experimental
            conditions improved in situational awareness across experimental conditions and in
            anticipation However, neither the experimental condition nor its interaction with
            time resulted in significant effect. The nonsignificant results are discussed within
            the general-specific transfer conceptual framework and future directions are introduced.

            detection is crucial. Thus, the objectives of this study were to (1) synthesize and
            coat Fe3O4 magnetic particles, (2) characterize the magnetic particles to determine
            the optimal coating concentration, and (3) construct glyphosate-specific molecularly
            imprinted polymers (GLY-MIPs) with the optimally coated Fe3O4 magnetic particles,
            which may have the ability to concentrate glyphosate and draw it out of the surrounding
            matrix for potential glyphosate detection. Iron(II, III) oxide magnetic particles
            (Fe3O4 MPs) were synthesized via co-precipitation at room temperature (RT). A modified
            Stöber method was used to coat Fe3O4 MPs with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). Particle
            size was determined using dynamic light scattering (DLS). The zeta-potential, the
            charge that develops at the interface between a solid surface and its liquid medium,
            was also investigated via DLS measurements. Light microscopy imaging was performed
            to study particle morphology and aggregation. The effect of temperature and pH on
            particle precipitation and the attraction of uncoated Fe3O4 MPs and silica-coated
            Fe3O4 MPs (Fe3O4@SiO2 MPs) to the external magnetic field were investigated to aid
            in determining the optimal TEOS coating concentration. Glyphosate-imprinted polymers
            and non-imprinted polymers (NIPs) with Fe3O4@SiO2 MPs as the core were constructed
            via free radical polymerization (18 h, 60°C). Particle size and zeta-potential of
            four coated Fe3O4@SiO2 MP samples with TEOS coating concentrations 0.067, 0.34, 1.7,
            3.3 mL/g Fe3O4 were obtained, respectively. Fe3O4@SiO2 MPs with TEOS coating concentration
            1.7 mL/g Fe3O4 were significantly smaller (P &lt; 0.05) than Fe3O4@SiO2 MPs with TEOS
            coating concentrations 0.067, 0.34, and 3.3 mL/g Fe3O4 (P &lt; 0.05). Also, Fe3O4@SiO2
            MPs with TEOS coating concentration 3.3 mL/g Fe3O4 were significantly larger (P &lt;
            0.05) than Fe3O4@SiO2 MPs with TEOS coating concentrations 0.067, 0.34, and 1.7 mL/g
            Fe3O4. In addition, Fe3O4@SiO2 MPs with TEOS coating concentrations 1.7 and 3.3 mL/g
            Fe3O4 had a significantly greater negative zeta-potential (mV) than Fe3O4@SiO2 MPs
            with TEOS coating concentrations 0.067 and 0.34 mL/g Fe3O4, indicating stability of
            the aforementioned Fe3O4@SiO2 MPs in colloidal suspension. Light microscopy imaging
            results showed aggregated uncoated Fe3O4 MPs. Also, coated Fe3O4@SiO2 MPs were shown
            to be less aggregated than uncoated Fe3O4 MPs. However, as the coating concentration
            increased, particle size and aggregation increased as well. An increase in aggregation
            may have resulted due to the coating of amorphous, non-uniform Fe3O4 MPs. Increasing
            temperature (37°C), increased the precipitation rate of uncoated Fe3O4 MPs and coated
            Fe3O4@SiO2 MPs suspended in degassed Distilled Deionized (DD) water, glycine-HCl (pH
            2.5), PBS (pH 7.2), and Tris-HCl (pH 10). Fe3O4@SiO2 MPs with TEOS coating concentration
            3.3 mL/g Fe3O4 displayed the most stability in colloidal suspension at RT and 37°C.
            The effect of pH on the precipitation rate of uncoated Fe3O4 MPs and coated Fe3O4@SiO2
            MPs showed the stability of Fe3O4@SiO2 MPs with TEOS coating concentration of 3.3
            mL/g Fe3O4 in colloidal suspension at acidic and basic pH. All uncoated Fe3O4 MPs
            and coated Fe3O4@SiO2 MPs did not show stability in colloidal suspension at a pH near
            the isoelectric point (pI) of Fe3O4. Fe3O4@SiO2 MPs with TEOS coating concentrations
            1.7 and 3.3 mL/g Fe3O4 did not attract to an external magnetic field as rapidly as
            compared to Fe3O4@SiO2 MPs with TEOS coating concentrations 0.067, 0.34, 10, 13, 17,
            25, 50 mL/g Fe3O4 because of their stability in colloidal suspension. Fe3O4 MPs and
            Fe3O4@SiO2 MPs with TEOS coating concentrations 0.34 and 3.3 mL/g Fe3O4 migrated in
            a 0.5% agarose gel. Through comprehensive characterization, the optimal TEOS coating
            concentration of the Fe3O4@SiO2 MPs tested was 3.3 mL/g Fe3O4 due to its particle
            size, zeta-potential, stability in colloidal suspending against pH and temperature,
            ability to attract to an external magnetic field, and migration in agarose gel electrophoresis.
            Glyphosate-imprinted polymers and NIPs were constructed with Fe3O4@SiO2 MPs with TEOS
            coating concentration 3.3 mL/g Fe3O4. The attraction of GLY-MIPs to an external magnetic
            field was quicker than the attraction of NIPs to an external magnetic field. This
            work serves as a basis for future optimization and application of magnetic glyphosate-imprinted
            polymers and the detection of glyphosate in foods.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Although the LGBTQ community, from all appearances, maintains a strong connection
            to libraries as safe spaces, it is unclear whether the libraries themselves are providing
            relevant resources and services to the community. In addition, LIS research on LGBTQ
            patrons has centered on collection development how-tos and high level, broad suggestions
            without evaluating the actual state of the libraries’ resources and services to these
            patrons. And even in the research that has considered small or rural libraries, none
            have focused on the rural and small town Southern U.S., which data has shown is the
            most inhospitable of regions in the U.S. for LGBTQ individuals. The purpose of this
            research was to explore the status of LGBTQ collections, particularly young adult
            collections, in rural and small libraries in Alabama and determine whether the librarians
            and staff in charge of these collections have an accurate view of what exists there.
            In addition, the research sought to discover whether there are active efforts to maintain
            and/or improve these collections and provide services to the LGBTQ community. In this
            project, I used two qualitative methods: content analysis of library catalogs and
            interviews. Seventy-seven library catalogs of small and rural libraries in Alabama
            were examined, and five librarians from this set of libraries were interviewed. I
            used open coding to analyze the interviews and used this in concert with the catalog
            data to build a picture of what the actual state of small and rural libraries in Alabama
            is. In the analysis, I found that the libraries, while they did have varying sizes
            of collections do contain some LGBTQ resources though the use of subject headings
            is inaccurate and vague in many cases. In addition, through the interview analysis,
            I found that what primarily affected what the libraries had on their shelves was an
            actively engaged librarian dedicated to proper collection development practices. This
            was exploratory research designed to create a foundation for future inquiry into the
            state of small and rural libraries in the U.S. South, something which has not been
            fully explored in LIS literature. Future research will be needed to better determine
            motivations and best practices for the larger group.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In recent years there has been increasing research on incorporating intelligent driver
            assistance systems (IDAS) into vehicular platforms to help drivers make better driving
            decisions and to make the roadways safer. The percentage of highway accidents in United
            States is steadily increasing every year. Current IDAS such as collision detection
            and avoidance systems use models of human behavior to improve the reliability of these
            systems and to help decrease driver workload. Modeling driver behavior is not a simple
            task. It involves aspects of psychology, physiology, data analysis, signal processing
            and engineering, to name a few. In the case of lane changing events, early detection
            of a driver’s intent to change lanes can be beneficial to systems that involve vehicle-
            to- vehicle communications. Moreover, a lane change prediction system, could be integrated
            into automatic aviation of the turn signal. Most published studies of lane change
            events are based on large scale vehicle trajectory data i.e steering angle, velocity
            and accelerations. Using this approach, a lane change prediction event is typically
            detected as soon as the driver initiates a lane change maneuver. Most vehicular trajectory
            model fails when a driver forgets to enable a turn signal before making a lane change.
            Hence, irrespective of having many automatic features equipped in modern day cars,
            the accident rate is still not decreasing. In such cases, biomedical signals may play
            an important role in detecting early driver intention. Besides vehicle dynamics (lane
            change, braking, acceleration), it is also important to understand the mental workload
            of the driver to maintain safety while travelling. Mental workload is directly related
            to distracted or non- distracted driving which varies with emotional changes. The
            mental workload can tremendously impact driving behavior and hence the detection of
            these factors will add driver safety on roadway. In this dissertation, we propose
            to utilize visual and cognitive information to detect a driver’s intent to change
            lanes and predict their mental distraction. Mental workload varies in different situations.
            For example, the amount of focus required during a lane change maneuver can be disrupted
            due to a secondary task like cell phone usage, talking to a co-passenger, a baby crying
            in the back seat or an unexpected news broadcasted on the car radio. Most of the research
            focuses on distracted driving using a cell phone, although more number of accidents
            are accounted on highways during talking to passengers. In this research, conversational
            task with co –passengers are considered as a situation, for intent analysis and cognitive
            workload analysis of the driver. A novel approach is developed that considers eye
            movements and cognitive attentiveness as distraction levels are increased during two
            different scenarios (i) single passenger driving and (ii) driving with passengers.
            This involves aspects of statistical analysis, signal processing, software engineering
            and machine learning techniques. Different types of statistical analysis techniques
            like normalization, correlation models are used in this research. Software development
            with TCL scripting is utilized to design real time virtual scenario for data collection.
            Signal Processing techniques like power spectral analysis, cognitive engagement ratio
            etc. are utilized to analyze brain signals. Artificial Intelligence methods are applied
            to help make accurate predictions of driver intent. Finally, Artificial Intelligence
            is a broad field that uses deep learning and machine learning algorithms to mimic
            human cognition. This research utilizes innovative machine learning tools like sklearn
            and tensor flow, to automate the process of behavior analysis. This work will inform
            research on lane-change prediction, behavior prediction and vehicular feedback analysis
            using an IDAS environment. Furthermore, this work considers factors that may impact
            the lane change detection and prediction of differential drivers including elderly
            drivers. This work also contributes an individual database that records driving behaviors
            during conversational tasks that other researchers can use to conduct behavior analysis
            research associated with this driving scenario. To author’s knowledge this is the
            first database that will be made available publicly for use in conversational task
            scenario in driving. This dissertation is composed of five chapters. Chapter 1 presents
            the introduction and back ground of IDAS research. It highlights various factors that
            contribute to detrimental road crashes and describes the research gap in this field.
            Chapter 2 includes a detailed literature review of all the studies that has been conducted
            in this field and also includes essential biological and artificial intelligence methods
            that are important to know in order this field. Chapter 3 outlines the methodology
            that has been adopted in this project. It includes description of virtual reality
            development procedure for collecting data from driver simulator, data collection procedure
            for various parameter in this research and also describes the mathematical models
            of each concept. Chapter 4 consists of results, discussion and the importance of novel
            distraction recognition algorithm. Finally, conclusion, limitations and future work
            are discussed in chapter 5.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Electromagnets are an important application of superconductivity as superconductors
            can provide large current density in the winding pack without any voltage drop or
            joule heating losses. High temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets have advantages
            over low temperature superconducting (LTS) magnets, particularly because HTS magnets
            have better stability and possibility of producing magnetic field higher than 20 T.
            However, protection of HTS magnets is challenging due to slow normal zone propagation
            (NZP). When the NZP is slow, the stored magnetic energy is dissipated at localized
            area where the hot spot temperature can rise significantly and can cause "burn-out"
            damage on the superconductor. The no-insulation (NI) HTS winding technique has been
            experimentally demonstrated to be a promising technology, particularly to prevent
            a coil from electric burn-out, and has made it possible to reach a magnetic field
            of 45.5 T at the magnet center. NI magnets are dry wound and this adds to the ease
            in construction of NI coils as difficult epoxy impregnation process or wet winding
            process can be eliminated. The lack of insulation makes the magnet compact due to
            larger engineering current density, Je. Je of up to 1580 A/mm2 has been reported in
            NI coils, which is significantly larger than observed in insulated counterparts. The
            lack of low strength insulation also makes the magnet robust. NI winding using REBCO
            does not require processing steps such as epoxy impregnation or heat treatment, making
            its construction faster and convenient. However, as seen from the evidences of mechanical
            damage (seen from microscopy and critical current measurement) on the 45.5 T insert
            coil, there is a limit to this otherwise exciting technology. This research explores,
            in both simulation and experiment, the post-quench behaviors of NI magnets to quantitatively
            understand their self-protecting mechanism. NI quench modeling is challenging due
            to its non-linear, extremely fast and interrelated multiphysical behavior. A lumped
            circuit model combined with heat transfer and solid mechanics models is used to explain
            electrical, thermal, and mechanical responses in detail at the magnet level. In this
            model, each subcoil is modeled as single inductor (L 􀀀M) with variable resistances
            in series (Rq) and in parallel (Rc). For this purpose, some magnets that have been
            constructed and quenched at 4.2 K are being analyzed, which are 1) a stack of 3 double-pancake
            (DP) coils, 2) 14.5 T insert in 31 T resistive magnet, 3) 2 DP insert in 31 T resistive
            magnet, 4) 7 T standalone magnet, 5) 26 T standalone magnet, 6) 13 T HTS insert in
            7 T background LTS magnet. The lessons learned from analysis of these magnets are
            presented in this work. The quench modeling allows us to look at temperature and stress
            in the magnet that are difficult to measure, but are important to make sure damages
            due to burn-out or overstraining do not occur during operation. With the lessons learned,
            this approach can now be used for future design of high field magnets to make sure
            mechanical damage during the magnet quench is prevented.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation contains emotion. In fact, it is about emotion, and particularly
            how emotions can disrupt and otherwise force us to reexamine our preconceived notions
            (or hypothetically predicted values) about important facets of our lives. This dissertation
            is also about autonomy and the prospect of death, and especially how human emotion
            changes the conversation surrounding these important topics. I am particularly interested
            in how the conversation about advance directives only indirectly (or often not at
            all) addresses emotion, given how emotionally invested most people are in their life
            (and, when they think about it, the prospect of their demise). I suggest in this dissertation
            that this is, at least plausibly and perhaps only in part, due to historically patriarchal
            forces that have caused a kind of cultural blindness surrounding emotion, though this
            is steadily being rectified by feminists and feminist allies. To return to advance
            directives, I intend to examine these medical documents from numerous angles. This
            examination becomes complicated by the cases that I have in mind, which are when advance
            directives are supposed to provide some measure of control and respect for autonomy
            for persons who will have dementia or other cognitively declining illnesses. These
            are popular cases in the literature to look at, but more than that, these are people
            who are potentially the most vulnerable in these important decisions because a person
            with dementia is no longer able to advocate for themselves in many cases, even if
            they have *advocated* for their interests previously via an advance directive. I intend
            to provide arguments that challenge their creation, arguments that challenge their
            sustained authority over incompetent patients, and arguments that show that other
            arguments in favor of them fail, perhaps for many reasons, but perhaps more importantly,
            because of their neglect of emotion. I do not intent to provide a robust theory of
            what an emotion is, but rather examine how they function in our decision-making and
            how considerations regarding the kind of knowledge and value they provide can help
            us recognize important realities that our cold rationality may miss. In the end, I
            do not argue that advance directives should be done away with entirely. Instead, I
            argue that the literature holds them in too high a regard in many cases, and even
            with the best of circumstances in completing them (which is by no means a common occurrence),
            the emotions provide several routes for argumentation that shows their authority over
            persons with dementia should be reduced to one tool among many in a complex and fraught
            decision-making process. Even if my arguments should fail to persuade the reader,
            I contend that examining such an important dimension of the human experience can only
            provide valuable insight and wisdom regarding an incredibly difficult issue.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of stroboscopic training on intermediate
            tennis players’ anticipatory response accuracy, response time, and self-efficacy.
            Participants (N=30) completed six on-court training sessions, where they returned
            serves for 30 minutes in their respective condition (i.e., stroboscopic medium frequency,
            stroboscopic low frequency, placebo glasses without a stroboscopic effect). Additionally,
            participants watched videos of tennis serves occluded just after racket-ball contact
            and were asked to anticipate the direction of the serve as quickly as possible. Measures
            collected included anticipatory response accuracy (i.e., number of correct responses),
            response time, and self-efficacy and were recorded four times throughout the study
            (i.e., pre, mid, post and 1-week after training). RM ANOVA analyses indicated that
            there were no significant differences among the groups for anticipatory response accuracy,
            response time and self-efficacy. Follow-up one-way ANOVAs indicated significant anticipatory
            accuracy response differences between the low frequency stroboscopic group as compared
            to the medium frequency and placebo groups. Specifically, subjects in the low frequency
            group were more accurate in their anticipatory response compared to the other groups.
            In general, it seems that stroboscopic training has little (or no) effect on anticipatory
            response of tennis serves. This study is unique because of the ecologically valid
            methods used in anticipatory training and measurement. Although the current study
            supports the notion that stroboscopic training does not improve anticipatory responses
            in tennis serves, additional research is necessary to examine other stroboscopic training
            methods (e.g., longer sessions for a longer period, different stroboscopic frequencies)
            and anticipatory response measurements (e.g., on court response to live serves) in
            tennis and other sports (e.g., baseball)

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Presently, green chemistry is a movement that proactively seeks to create alternative
            and earth-friendly processes. It is a growing field open for innovation and cost-effective
            measures to enrich the scientific community while catering to an increasing world
            population. A technique available to green chemistry is photochemistry. The use of
            light as a means of chemical change can offer energy saving solutions to chemical
            reactions performed in organic chemistry. 1,2-diazine N-oxides are bench top stable
            starting materials rendering them useful building blocks for complex molecules. The
            photochemistry of pyridazine N-oxides has not been rigorously exploited because of
            the lack of efficient regioselective access and inability to control competitive reactions.
            They possess the potential for development of many reaction pathways, including ring-opening
            and photoreduction. During our investigations of the photochemical ring-opening, we
            observed an intermediate that is formed after exposure to UV light. To the best of
            our knowledge, this transient compound has not been isolated or heavily exploited
            for new reactions. Herein, I will describe our efforts to exploit this (Z)-diazoenone
            intermediate for applications in heterocycle synthesis using heat and transition metal
            catalysis The first strategic use of pyridazine N-oxide to nitrogen heterocycles is
            disclosed. Our synthesis began with readily available 3,6-dichloropyridazine N-oxide
            and a regioselective Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling with PdCl2dppf which selectively
            couples at C3. Furthermore, aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions were amenable toward
            these electron deficient heterocycles to furnish a library of non-symmetric photosubstrates.
            Upon photolysis with UV light (hv= 350 nm) and elevated temperatures, photochemical
            ring opening was observed to provide elaborate pyrazole motifs. We varied the electronics
            of pyridazine N-oxides at C3 with electron withdrawing and electron donating aryl
            groups. C6 was functionalized with various nucleophiles including nitrogen, oxygen
            and sulfur. Additionally, we were able to demonstrate this method as a tool in synthesis
            in our first application to a target molecule. We found reaction conditions to distinguish
            between competitive ring opening reaction pathways (1) thermal cyclization to afford
            pyrazole and (2) formation of a π-excessive building block, 2-aminofuran. However,
            2-aminofurans are labile and readily oxidize in air, rendering them buildings with
            obvious limitations. We report a method to synthesize 2-aminofurans using a combination
            of UV light and rhodium catalysis. These reactive intermediates are used in Diels-Alder
            cycloaddition reactions with alkenes to give entry to heterocyclic scaffolds found
            within natural products such as carbazoles and dibenzofurans. Our scope highlighted
            N-oxides with nucleophilic nitrogen and oxygen as an extension of the library of N-oxides
            used for pyrazole formation. Moreover, we harnessed the functionality of these scaffolds
            from synthetically accessible pyridazine N-oxides using our established regioselective
            approach to non-symmetric N-oxides. We were able to find dienophiles compatible with
            our system extending the groups incorporated into the carbazole skeletons. In our
            system, we found limitations and describe our efforts to rationalize our observations.
            In our quest of finding the synthetic utility of 2-aminofurans in Diels-Alder chemistry,
            we found 2-aminofurans harboring a nitrogen nucleophile in the ortho position of the
            aryl ring at C3, as introduceing new reactivity producing 1H-indole-2-acetamide. Indole
            scaffolds have a wide array of value in organic synthesis. Our strategy is to explore
            the acid-catalyzed isomerization of 2-aminofuran to functionalized indoles that would
            be difficult to make. Ring opening of heterocyclic N-oxides can be a powerful tool
            in organic synthesis. Key to our success was access to pyridazine N-oxides with functionality
            around the pyridazine nucleus that allowed for control of the competitive pathways.

            from researchers about teachers’ and speech-language pathologists’ (SLP) perceptions
            of NMAE use within academic settings, along with the methods that teachers’ and SLPs’
            use to respond to linguistic differences. The purpose of this current research was
            to examine first, third, and fifth-grade teachers’ and elementary school-based SLPs’
            perceptions of and responses to the African American English (AAE) dialect based on
            oral and written language examples. A survey method elicited demographic information,
            perceptions, and responses to AAE use from participants. Descriptive analyses revealed
            that the participants had negative perceptions of AAE use. Chi Square and logistic
            regression analyses revealed that perceptions did not impact the likelihood of the
            participants responding using the actions provided. Neither professional development
            nor whether or not the participants reported to use AAE themselves was associated
            with most of the responses to students’ use of AAE. The results suggest that teachers
            and SLPs have negative perceptions regarding students AAE use. However, the participants’
            perceptions were less likely to influence how they respond to AAE use.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The emergence of an unparalleled punitive response to criminal offending in the 1970s
            fueled a nation-wide prison boom that continued through the first decade of the 21st
            century (Campbell and Vaughn, 2019; Mears and Cochran, 2015; Travis, Western, and
            Redburn, 2014; Clear and Frost, 2014). Growing pessimism regarding the rehabilitation
            of offenders precipitated the shift to policies and practices that emphasized deterrence,
            incapacitation, and retribution over treatment (Garland, 2001; Simon, 2007; Gottschalk,
            2006). This “get-tough” movement had lasting consequences for both the process of
            prisoner reentry (Travis, 2005; Seiter and Kadela, 2003) and the inmate experience
            (Kreager and Kruttschnitt, 2018). These sweeping changes may have also had implications
            for the efficacy of rehabilitative programs that continued to operate despite rhetoric
            that “nothing worked.” In-prison vocational training, for example, maintained widespread
            support during this period (Cullen and Travis, 1984) and continues to be one of the
            most widely available rehabilitative programs (Turner, 2018; Phelps, 2011; Stephan,
            2008; Taxman, Perdoni, and Harrison, 2007). The permanence of vocational programs
            since its implementation during the early 20th century (MacKenzie, 2008) likely derives
            from its purported practicality for offender reentry. Former prisoners frequently
            identify employment as one of the most critical needs during the transition process
            (Western, 2018; Visher and Travis, 2011; Morani, Wikoff, Linhorst, and Bratton, 2011).
            Programs like vocational training can help this situation by potentially increasing
            one’s work qualifications and employment prospects. Application of a variety of desistance
            and criminological theories suggests that these programs may be able to reduce future
            offending as well through pathways of individual change and employment. Indeed, a
            large body of prior research finds that vocational training can improve post-prison
            outcomes (Davis, Bozick, Steele, Saunders, and Miles, 2013; Wilson, Gallagher, and
            MacKenzie, 2000). Yet, there is little systematic research that evaluates the strengths
            and limitations of evidence to date, examines the use of vocational training, and
            rigorously assesses its effects. Accordingly, this dissertation examines four interrelated
            research questions. First, what is the state of evidence on vocational training? Second,
            what is vocational training and who gets it? Third, what is the effect of vocational
            training on post-release employment and recidivism? Fourth, do participant factors
            condition vocational training effectiveness? This dissertation finds that the current
            evidence base for vocational training contains a number of research gaps and methodological
            shortcomings. Using data from the Florida Department of Corrections, the current study
            highlights that vocational programs involve training for a diverse range of trades
            but relatively few inmates experience it and of those who do, enrollment is driven
            by certain characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race). Regression-based estimates of
            treatment efficacy indicate that attainment of a vocational certificate significantly
            improves post-prison employment and reduces the rate of recidivism. However, a matching-based
            approach reveals marginal benefits for employment and decreases in future offending.
            Finally, this study reveals that the effect of a training certificate on recidivism
            vary across different prisoner groups. Collectively, these findings suggest several
            implications for theory, research, and policy.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This project examines indigenous made ceramics recovered from two contemporaneous
            Spanish Mission period sites in Apalachee Province of La Florida. The study focuses
            on Colonoware, a ceramic type made using non-European manufacturing methods that mimic
            or are influenced by European ceramic vessel forms. For both samples, sherds possessing
            qualities that could tie them to forms used in European table service such as cups,
            brimmed plates and bowls, or pitchers were used as markers of Colonoware. Mission
            Red Filmed was identified solely based on red pigmentation, and while form and temper
            were analyzed and recorded those qualities were not the basis for identification for
            this type. The most substantial issue in ceramic studies is the lack of a concrete
            and widely applicable classification for this type. The term Colonoware is widely
            applied to sites of different cultural and temporal contexts. In this study I propose
            a reformed system of nomenclature that more accurately depicts the context in which
            these ceramics are found.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Eating disorders (EDs) are associated with increased risk for suicide. Recent research
            suggests that excessive exercise (EE), an ED compensatory behavior, may increase suicide
            risk via increasing one’s capability for suicide which is comprised of an elevated
            pain tolerance and a diminished fear of death. However, additional research is needed
            to determine the exact mechanisms by which EE may influence capability for suicide.
            Specifically, no studies to date have examined the influence of EE and eating pathology
            on behavioral indices of capability for suicide. The present study had two aims: 1)
            this study sought to examine how EE engagement and ED status influences pain avoidance
            behaviors in comparison to controls; and 2) the second aim of the present study was
            to determine how EE engagement and ED status influence fear of death and avoidance
            of death-related stimuli. We recruited 87 participants based on ED and EE status (22
            controls, 22 EE only, 21 ED only, and 22 ED+EE). Hierarchical regression with dummy
            coding was used to compare our groups on the following outcomes: 1) breakpoint and
            total key presses on a pain avoidance progressive ratio task (CPT); and 2) breakpoint
            and total key presses on a death avoidance progressive ratio task (viewing and rating
            of suicide images). The results of the present study provide preliminary, albeit mixed
            support for our hypotheses. Specifically, we found that the EE only (β = -0.31, p
            = .017) and ED only (β = -0.30, p = 0.02) groups differed significantly from controls
            on one measure of pain avoidance (CPT PR breakpoint); the ED only group (β = -0.31,
            p = .017) differed significantly from controls on one measure of death avoidance (suicide-related
            images PR total presses). However, our ED group characterized by EE did not differ
            significantly from controls on any of our behavioral measures. See supplementary file
            for Tables 1 and 2 which provide group comparisons on main variables of interest (Table
            1) and a correlation matrix for continuous variables (Table 2). Exploration of these
            findings, limitations, and areas for future research are included in our general discussion.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>There is a well-documented sexual dimorphism in the neural control of food intake
            and body weight regulation. Estradiol is a leading candidate as a potential biological
            factor contributing to these sex differences due to its robust anorexigenic effect.
            However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving estradiol’s anorexigenic effect
            are poorly understood. The goal of this dissertation was to investigate several potential
            mechanisms underlying estradiol’s effect on energy homeostasis in female rats. Many
            of estradiol’s behavioral effects are mediated, at least partially, via extra-nuclear
            estradiol signaling. Here, we investigated whether two estrogen receptor (ER) agonists,
            targeting ERα and G protein-coupled ER-1 (GPER-1), could promote rapid anorexigenic
            effects in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Our findings demonstrated that selective activation
            of ERα produces a rapid (within 1 h) decrease in food intake that is best explained
            by a non-genomic signaling pathway and thus implicates the involvement of extra-nuclear
            ERα. We also found that activation of GPER-1 is both sufficient to suppress feeding
            and necessary for ERa agonist, PPT’s, rapid anorexigenic effect. Next, we investigated
            estradiol’s impact on the Janus kinase – signal transducer and activator of transcription
            (JAK-STAT) pathway in the hypothalamus of OVX rats and in cultured proopiomelanocortin
            (POMC) neurons. The JAK-STAT pathway mediates leptin’s anorexigenic effect and previous
            work has shown that estradiol also activates this pathway in male mice. However, the
            specific estrogen receptor subtype and neuronal phenotype has not been investigated
            in the rat. Here, we show that activation of ERa in OVX rats increases the expression
            of phosphorylated STAT3 in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) and activation of
            both ERa and GPER-1 increases the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STAT3 in
            cultured POMC neurons. In addition to investigating the effects of estradiol under
            normal, chow-fed, conditions, we wanted to investigate the effects of estradiol in
            animals consuming a palatable high fat diet (HFD). Previous work has shown consumption
            of a HFD increases inflammation in the hypothalamus in male mice and rats, but little
            to no work has been conducted in females. Here, we showed for the first time that
            acute HFD exposure increases microgliosis, as measured by an increase in the number
            of cells expressing the microglia-specific protein Iba1, and decreased microglial
            branching and complexity in the hypothalamus and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS)
            of OVX rats. These data suggest that HFD increased microglial accumulation and activation
            in the hypothalamus and hindbrain. Estradiol replacement blocked the HFD-induced increase
            in microglia in the hypothalamus and hindbrain and reduced microglia activation in
            the hypothalamus. These data provide the first in vivo evidence that estradiol may
            play a protective role in diet-induced inflammation in female rats. In addition to
            increasing microglial activity, consumption of a HFD has been shown to negatively
            impact neuronal health in the hypothalamus. In vitro studies have shown that treatment
            of hypothalamic neurons with palmitate, a common dietary saturated fat, increases
            markers of both inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In our study, we showed
            that treating cultured POMC neurons with palmitate increased mRNA expression of interleukin-6
            (IL-6), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B), and
            CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP). Pre-treatment with estradiol
            attenuated the palmitate-induced increase in IL-6 and treatment with the selective
            GPER-1 agonist, G-1, attenuated increases in IL-6 and NF-kB mRNA caused by palmitate.
            These data suggest that estradiol attenuates markers of inflammation caused by saturated
            fat, but has no effect on a marker of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Taken together,
            these studies demonstrate that estradiol affects energy homeostasis via activation
            of extra-nuclear receptors, JAK-STAT activity, and decreasing the neuroimmune response
            to diet.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The central characters of How To Make Love To An Apple are a mother and daughter.
            The first part of the book takes place in the girl's memory of her childhood in Arizona
            at the house where she grew up with her mother and father. The girl is the central
            protagonist. She is Turkish-American, born and raised in Arizona. The girl's mother
            and father moved to the United States before the girl was born. There is no explicit
            explanation provided in the book as to why they chose to settle in Arizona. But one
            comes to understand through the sections of the girl's childhood memories, that the
            father was older and had made enough money to retire and build a small estate. The
            father commits suicide when the girl is a teenager at which point she is sent to boarding
            school in New York. Central conflict presents itself in the form of a third major
            character: The American. The girl and her mother meet him while on vacation in Turkey,
            a trip meant to celebrate the girl’s high school graduation. When The American materializes,
            he imposes his presence upon the mother and in consequence, the girl. At first, she
            is resentful of this, of his interruption, of his loud voice, of his showy clothes,
            of the giddy ways of her mother around him. But The American is also a way for the
            girl to discover the force of her own sexuality, of her own seduction.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Recent advancements in multicultural psychology show that racial minorities experience
            trauma symptoms as a result of stress-inducing racial-based events (Carter, 2007).
            In response, Evans et al. (2015) proposed using a post-traumatic growth (PTG) framework
            to help individuals with race-based trauma (RBT) to enhance their sense of autonomy,
            connection, and life purpose (Joseph et al., 2012b). However, no research to date
            has empirically examined the relationship between these variables. The current study
            examined the amount of variance of PTG explained by racial identity attitudes and
            mindfulness facets in Black Americans who meet criteria for RBT. The identified independent
            variables of mindfulness and racial attitudes were selected as they have been shown
            to impact the appraisal process directly (Hanley et al., 2015) and indirectly (Franklin-Jackson
            &amp; Carter, 2007), respectively. The sample consisted of 134 self-identified Black adults
            (≥18) who met criteria for RBT, as measured by the Race-Based Trauma Stress Symptom
            Scale (Carter, 2007). PTG, racial identity attitudes, and mindfulness facets were
            measured using the Psychological Well-Being Post-Traumatic Changes Questionnaire (Joseph
            et al., 2012), the Cross Racial Identity Scale (Cross &amp; Vandiver, 2001), and the Five-Facet
            Mindfulness Questionnaire (Baer et al., 2008). Results of a hierarchical multiple
            regression showed that the complete model accounted for 35% of PTG, where Self-Hatred
            attitudes (β = -.29), Anti-White attitudes (β = -.32), and Act with Awareness (β =
            .22) emerged as significant predictors. This exploratory study provides partial support
            for the relationship between racial identity attitudes, multicultural facets, and
            PTG in the context of Black Americans experiencing RBT. The current study provides
            a foundation for future research treating race-based injuries and promoting PTG in
            the Black population.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Current events would suggest that activism against gender inequality is on the rise
            in the United States. However, more action is needed if gender equality is to be achieved.
            To better understand these events and to encourage greater participation, two studies
            explore potential underlying mechanisms that explain men and women’s intentions to
            participate in social movements for women’s rights (antisexist collective action intent).
            Using bystander intervention theory (Latane &amp; Darley, 1969) as a guide, we theorized
            that people who identify inequalities in their environments as systemic sexism (systemic
            sexism perception) are more likely to be driven by prescriptive moral convictions
            that one must proactively advocate for women’s rights (antisexist motivation). This
            motivation is predicted to consequently increase both men and women’s antisexist collective
            action intent. Cross-sectional data demonstrated that systemic sexism perception predicted
            antisexist motivation, and both variables predicted antisexist collective action intent,
            for both men and women (over and above other predictors). An experiment demonstrated
            that participants who were exposed to a video outlining the effects of systemic sexism
            on the STEM gender gap (vs. a control) were more likely to believe systemic sexism
            contributes to this gap, thereby experiencing greater antisexist motivation and collective
            action intent. The implications of these findings are discussed and future lines of
            research are proposed.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Research has shown that the quality of preschool teacher-child relationships can forecast
            children’s social-emotional development, academic achievement, and school attitude;
            these benefits are amplified for impoverished children. However, teachers tend to
            have conflictual relationships with children living in poverty. Additionally, research
            in this area mostly focuses on either teacher or child factors. Therefore, driven
            by the educational dilemma and research gap, I investigated contributions of both
            teacher and child factors to teacher-child relationships in preschools serving children
            living in poverty (i.e., attending Head Start). Stemming from a preliminary study,
            this study examined the relations of child gender, problem behavior, teacher-child
            racial/ethnic match, and teacher education and job stress to teacher-reported teacher-child
            relationships. Based on the estimations of a priori power analyses, 129 teachers and
            635 children from collaborating Head Start agencies across the U.S. were recruited
            in this study. Teachers completed a set of well-validated self- and child-focused
            questionnaires through an online survey system. Considering the nested nature of data
            (children clustered within classes), a multilevel modeling approach was employed for
            data analysis. Several main findings emerged: First, boys tended to have more conflictual
            relationships and girls tended to have closer relationships with teachers, which could
            be partially explained by their different levels of problem behaviors. Second, teacher-child
            racial/ethnic match did not play a role in the quality of teacher-child relationships.
            Third, having a degree (AA, BA, and MA), as compared to having a certificate (i.e.,
            CDA) was associated with a closer and less conflictual teacher-child relationship.

            conflict. Implications were discussed in this study.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This study investigated the relationships among Chinese undergraduate English learners’
            motivation for learning English (i.e., students’ internal choice, students’ external
            pressure), integrative orientation (i.e., students’ engagement with the target language
            culture or community), students’ perceptions of psychological need satisfaction, English
            self-efficacy, classroom engagement, and their English academic achievement. The theoretical
            framework underlying this study is Self-Determination Theory (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000a,
            2000b, 2017). To investigate the relationships among the variables, a quantitative
            research methodology of a full structural equation model with single indicators was
            used. Although language learners’ motivation for learning a second/foreign language
            is a well-studied construct, there is a paucity of studies to investigate whether
            or not Self-Determination Theory applies to Chinese collectivistic culture for understanding
            Chinese college English language learners’ motivation for learning English. The purpose
            of this dissertation study was to investigate the relationships among Chinese undergraduate
            English language learners’ personal variables (i.e., motivation for learning English,
            integrative orientation, English self-efficacy, classroom engagement, and English
            academic achievement) and contextual variables (i.e., students’ perceptions of psychological
            need satisfaction) in a full structural model. The participants of this study were
            1,378 Chinese undergraduate English majors from middle-level national public universities
            in the Southeast of China. Findings of the current study showed that Chinese undergraduate
            English language-learners, who were primarily regulated by internal choice (i.e.,
            intrinsic regulation, identified regulation), were likely to perceive that teachers
            met their psychological-needs for intrinsic motivation, and to have greater intentions
            to engage in the target-language culture and community, which in turn predicted their
            learning-related beliefs (e.g., a high sense of English efficacy), learning-related
            behaviors (e.g., active involvement in learning activities), and English achievement.
            Nevertheless, students who were primarily regulated by externally-controlled reasons
            for learning English, including introjected regulation (i.e., performing a task to
            avoid feeling guilty), external regulation (i.e., performing a task for obtaining
            rewards), and parental persuasion (i.e., parents’ influence toward learning English)
            were also likely to perceive that their teachers met their psychological-needs, which
            may have influenced their intention to integrate into the target-language culture
            and community. This dissertation study investigated Chinese undergraduate English
            learners’ motivation for learning English as a foreign language and the consequent
            learning outcomes. Findings of this study broadened understandings of students’ motivation
            for learning a language by showing how students’ initial reasons for learning a language
            may influence their learning beliefs, classroom engagement, and language achievement.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This thesis studied the electronic structure at the Fermi level and the topological
            character of topological semimetals via torque magnetometry. Torque magnetometry measures
            the anisotropic magnetization of the sample in a tilted magnetic field. In our measurements,
            the magnetic field is up to 35 T and the temperature is down to 300 mK. The oscillatory
            signal of the magnetization is detected, which is the so called “de Hass van Alphen
            (dHvA)” effect. By using dHvA effect, many important parameters such as the geometry
            of Fermi surfaces, effective masses, quantum mobilities, Land ́e g factors and Berry’s
            phases. It is especially important for the Berry’s phase extraction. It is known that
            if there is a cyclotron orbit encircling a Dirac node, a non-trivial Berry’s phase
            π can be extracted and a trivial Berry’s phase 0 is expected for a conventional parabolic
            band. In the study of MAl3, we provided a detailed study of the dHvA oscillations
            and provided a comparison with the calculated band structures. The angular dependence
            of their Fermi surface cross-sectional areas reveals a remarkably good agreement with
            our first-principles calculations. dHvA supports the existence of tilted Dirac cones
            with Dirac type-II nodes located at 100, 230 and 250 meV above the Fermi level EF
            for VAl3,NbAl3 and TaAl3 respectively, in agreement with the prediction of broken
            Lorentz invariance in these compounds. However, for all three compounds we find that
            the cyclotron orbits on their FSs, including an orbit nearly enclosing the Dirac type-II
            node, yield trivial Berry phases. We showed that if one would like to derive a convincing
            Berry’s phase from quantum oscillations one has to take into account the spin dephasing
            term in the LK formalism, and the precise location between the cyclotron orbit and
            the Dirac node. M2Te2X is studied via both torque magnetometry and angle-resolved
            photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Bulk two-dimensional Fermi surfaces are well-described
            by the dHvA oscillations and first principles calculations. Intriguingly, slab electronic
            structure calculations predict Dirac-like surface states at different locations within
            the Brillouin zone, which is consistent with ARPES observations.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Capital control policies, such as certificate of need (CON) regulations, are often
            touted as a means of combatting the rising costs of healthcare. However, such policies
            often have little to no concern with their impact on health outcomes. This dissertation
            examines this impact. The first chapter, “The Impact of Certificate of Need Laws on
            Heart Attack Mortality,” explores the relationship between heart attack deaths and
            CON laws, assessing the differential impact on states adopting CON regulation between
            1968 and 1982. Using neighboring counties on opposite sides of a state border to account
            for the endogeneity of healthcare preferences across regions, I find that the introduction
            of CON regulations led to 6-7 additional heart attack deaths per 100,000 (which represents
            a 4.2% increase in deaths relative to the pre-CON mean). The goal of the next two
            chapters is to explain possible mechanisms that links CON policies to the additional
            deaths. The second chapter, “Health Returns to Hospital-Level Capital Investments:
            Evidence from Endowment Shocks,” measures the effect of capital on health outcomes.
            Taking advantage of the fact that non-profit hospitals follow a rigid endowment spending
            policy based upon the market value of their endowments, my coauthor (Shawn Kantor)
            and I develop an instrumental variable for current capital spending that is based
            upon each non-profit hospital's endowment level interacted with stock market shocks
            over time. Using patient-level discharge data from non-profit hospitals in the state
            of Florida from 2006 to 2014, we find that for every $1,000,000 increase in a hospital's
            capital expenditure, mortality decreases by 0.0062 to 0.0123 percentage point for
            the average ER visitor, and 0.0064 to 0.0110 percentage point for the average patient
            admitted to the hospital. This equates to about 6.2 to 12.3 individuals per 100,000.
            This effect, however, is economically small, since the average hospital treats 1,357
            patients per year. Finally, the third chapter, “Using Certificate of Need Regulations
            to Deter Entry into the Healthcare Market: Case Study of Florida Prior to Repeal,”
            is a case study of Florida's CON regulations prior to repeal in 2019. The goal is
            to provide a description of the CON approval process for future research on the impact
            of CON. This chapter explores the traditional methods of entry deterrence in the healthcare
            market then discusses how the regulatory environment may provide an additional option
            for incumbents to use unproductive capital to deter entry into a CON regulatory environment.
            I then provide an exploratory analysis of whether an incumbent has an impact on CON
            approval, conditional on the entrant reaching the decision to file a CON application,
            and briefly describe what needs to be accounted for in any future analysis.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation aims to enhance our understanding of social enterprise, particularly
            from the perspective of public policy and management. More specifically, the three
            papers within this dissertation attempt to make three significant contributions to
            the existing literature on this topic. The first paper explores the potential of social
            enterprise as a platform for co-production through illustrations from international
            practice. Combining social enterprise research and co-production literature, it presents
            a conceptual framework of the relationship between social enterprise and co-production.
            The findings also help public administrators to better understand the advantages of
            social enterprise for co-production. The second paper examines the impact of government
            funding on public value creation. Linking public policy and organizational performance,
            this paper contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between government
            and social enterprise. The findings also provide policymakers with practical guidance
            on how to promote social enterprise so that it can create more social outcomes. The
            third paper investigates the impact of social enterprise’s social orientation on the
            organizational commitment of individuals working for social enterprises from the perspective
            of public management. This paper contributes both to social enterprise research and
            organizational commitment literature by uncovering what promotes the organizational
            commitment of individuals working for social enterprises. In addition, through unpacking
            the difference between millennials and earlier generations in regard to organizational

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Anxiety disorders occur early in development and are one of the most common forms
            of psychopathology in children. Moreover, anxiety is associated with persistent impairment
            across the lifespan; therefore, investigating mechanisms that underlie anxiety in
            early childhood is crucial for prevention and intervention efforts. A fearful temperament
            in childhood has been shown to predict anxiety across development. Decreased cognitive
            control and threat-related attentional biases have also been linked to the development
            of anxiety, but little to no work has examined how temperament (i.e., fearfulness)
            and cognitive control may simultaneously predict threat-related attentional bias.
            Additionally, previous work on attentional bias has used less reliable reaction time
            (RT) based measures of attention. In the present study, we 1) investigated the psychometric
            properties of an eye-tracking measure of attentional bias, 2) tested if fearfulness
            and cognitive control were related to attentional biases to threat, and 3) examined
            if these relationships had unique or overlapping effects. Results showed good psychometric
            properties, comparable to that found in adult eye-tracking studies. However, contrary
            to our hypothesis, fearfulness and cognitive control did not significantly predict
            threat/neutral dwell time and attentional biases. Future studies may explore if cognitive
            control and fearfulness prospectively predict threat attentional bias and the onset
            of anxiety using a longitudinal design.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Media are important agents of socialization. Accordingly, media images reflect as
            well as inform what characteristics symbolize feminine beauty. In the field of female
            beauty and fashion magazines in the U.S., visual portrayals of women with characteristics
            such as a thin body shape, Caucasian skin color, blue eye color, and blonde hair color
            are so frequent that these characteristics are viewed as symbols of ideal feminine
            beauty. However, recent changes in the fashion magazine field indicate a potential
            for newer, more diverse representations. Body positivity advocates utilize Internet
            Communication Technologies (ICTs) to organize and engage in body politics as they
            petition magazines to take ‘body oaths,’ a promise to incorporate more inclusive portrayals
            of feminine beauty. This research utilizes field theory to explore magazine readers
            and activist groups use of social media to engage, praise, and critique the fashion
            magazine field in an effort to change the field and its content. A quantitative content
            analysis is used to compare the body portrayals found in the pictorial content of
            four different teen girls’ and women’s print magazines and their Instagram accounts
            (Glamour, Cosmopolitan, Seventeen, and Teen Vogue during the summer and fall editions/months
            of 2016 and 2017) and a qualitative analysis looks at user engagement on the magazines’
            Instagram accounts. This data addresses the question: Are the changes in the female
            fashion magazine field enough to challenge field practices that subjugate female beauty
            to narrow definitions where thin bodies are constructed as the embodiment of ideal
            femininity? Considering body ideals as social constructions, meaning they are created,
            maintained, and also re-created, by a particular society and particular fields embedded
            within a society. This research considers how factors inside and outside the magazine
            field act upon the magazine outlet’s constructed ideals of femininity specifically
            as it relates to bodies. The current research provides three key contributions to
            the field. First, the study asks whether sociological understanding of contemporary
            pictorial representations of bodies in popular media is changing within the field
            of female fashion magazines. Secondly, the research furthers understanding of the
            interactions between movement activists and readers and technological changes in light
            of the dynamics of the media field. Finally, the study helps us more thoroughly understand
            the way body ideals are constructed and reconstructed. The research addresses the
            following topics: gender, social movements and media

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Healthcare professions are faced with a problem, a shortage of underrepresented minorities
            (URM) who resemble the racial, ethnic, and gender structure of the community that
            they will one day serve. Further impacting this problem is the fact that fewer URMs
            are entering medical schools. Pipeline programs have been identified as one possible
            solution to increasing URM matriculation into medicals schools. This study aimed to
            determine the effectiveness of one medical pipeline program, the Florida State University
            College of Medicine’s Bridge to Clinical Medicine Program, in attaining student goals.
            Building on existing research about pipeline programs, the research asked about the
            pre-medical school characteristics of Bridge Program students, their academic outcomes,
            and perceptions about the program. Based on a review of pipeline program literature,
            an online survey was developed and distributed to all former Bridge Program students,
            approximately 150 students. Student academic data was obtained to include all 18 years
            of the Bridge Program to compare student performance. An analysis of the data and
            survey responses indicated the Bridge Program is meeting the student focused short
            and intermediate goals. Long-term goals were not addressed due to the small number
            of Bridge students that have graduated the program, medical school, and completed
            residency programs. Data and survey responses provided a better understanding of how
            Bridge students compared to other students admitted directly into the medical school
            program. Survey responses offered former Bridge student perceptions about their experiences
            and impact of the program. Based on the findings, the main recommendations include
            enhancement of existing mentoring and research activities, more high-stakes examination
            preparations, moving to a pass/fail grading system, as well as making the Bridge Program
            more visible through publicity, recognition, and additional research. Overall, the
            Bridge Program has met the student focused goals and could benefit from enhancements
            to current activities and continued research.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Protein residue ionization often plays a vital role in protein function, such as enzyme
            catalysis and pH-dependent structural changes. Inadequate conformational and protonation
            state sampling in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has limited the accuracy of
            predictions of residue pKa values and structural change concomitant to residue ionization
            state change. As part of an ongoing effort in the Yang lab to address this conformational
            sampling issue, we developed a novel enhanced sampling MD simulation method, called
            adaptive dynamic reporting (ADR). In this thesis, we show that the ADR method has
            excellent accuracy, precision, and convergence time for a wide range of simulation
            parameter sets and order parameters, compared to previously established methods. Next,
            using ADR-based high-order orthogonal space tempering (OST) methods, we studied a
            number of ionization-dependent properties for all human oxidized C62A/C69A/C73A thioredoxin
            ionizable residues. To carry our this study, we developed a novel alchemical OST pKa
            titration scheme: 1) to sample the relevant protonation microstates of thioredoxin,
            and 2) to calculate the microscopic pKa values, protonation microstate populations,
            titration curves, and apparent pKa for all human oxidized C62A/C69A/C73A thioredoxin
            ionizable residues. The OST pKa simulations accurately predict the apparent pKa values
            for each of these residues. Moreover, from our OST pKa simulations we identified novel
            thioredoxin conformations and dynamics corresponding to biologically essential ionization
            states. These long-timescale, ionization-coupled motions observed were in good agreement
            with NMR spectroscopy observations of homologous thioredoxin. In addition, we were
            able to utilize the observed the ionization-coupled dynamics of human oxidized C62A/C69A/C73A
            thioredoxin to identify possible sources of the pKa shifts for several titratable
            residues. We then studied ionization coupling between residues using their deprotonation
            free energies. Several interacting residues showed nonlinear deprotonation free energies
            over various pH ranges. In summary, there are four main contributions in this dissertation.
            First, we developed and analyzed a novel, rigorous, and widely-applicable enhanced
            sampling method, ADR. Second, we developed a novel titration scheme, and in combination
            with OST pKa simulations, calculated and analyzed all of the residue microscopic pKa
            values in human oxidized C62A/C69A/C73A thioredoxin. Third, we established how the
            hierarchical dynamics of thioredoxin are constructed to respond to external pH perturbations
            by characterizing novel protonation-dependent dynamics of thioredoxin. Finally, we
            extensively studied inter-residue ionization cooperativity in thioredoxin by calculating
            residue deprotonation free energies and by analyzing the dynamics of thioredoxin coupled
            to the ionization of these residues.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This study investigated the effects of a problem solving instructional strategy known
            as Modified Schema Based Instruction (MSBI) on the Mathematical Practices of four
            students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The Common Core State Standards for
            Mathematics highlight the importance of not only content standards for mathematics,
            but also mathematical practices such as communication, representation, and reasoning.
            Students with ASD often demonstrate difficulties with these skills as a result of
            deficits in social communication, theory of mind, and executive functioning. Through
            a multiple probe across participants design, this study demonstrates that MSBI is
            an effective strategy to increase the use of mathematical practices for middle school
            students with ASD when solving multiplicative word problems. Four students eligible
            for special education services under the area of autism enrolled in sixth grade general
            education mathematics classes increased their use of mathematical practices for both
            problem types taught (multiplicative comparison and proportion), and maintained the
            use of some mathematical practices 4-8 weeks after intervention. Additionally, all
            four participants generalized their use of mathematical practices to novel multiplicative
            comparison problems containing extraneous information while three of the participants
            generalized mathematical practice skills to proportion problems containing extraneous
            information. Implications for practice are discussed.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In factor analysis, determining the number of factors underlying measurement indicators
            is important. An incorrect decision on the number of factors may mislead practitioners
            in terms of estimating parameters in factor analysis, reporting students’ scores,
            calibrating items through an item response theory model, equating or linking different
            test forms, estimating reliability, examining differential item functioning, and investigating
            validity. Exploratory factor analysis, parallel analysis, Kaiser’s rule, and Cattell’s
            scree test are commonly used methods for deciding on the number of factors in educational
            and psychological assessments. When a test consists of multiple-choice or ordinal-scaled
            items, some test takers might find the correct answers to the items through guessing.
            The guessing effect might impact the correlation coefficients among items. Thus, it
            might also impact the decisions on the number of factors via exploratory factor analysis,
            parallel analysis, Kaiser’s rule, and Cattell’s scree test. These four methods do
            not consider the guessing effects through modeling a guessing parameter when examining
            the dimensionality of data. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the impact
            of guessing on the performance of exploratory factor analysis, parallel analysis,
            Kaiser’s rule, and Cattell’s scree test in determining the number of factors underlying
            measurement indicators. Among these four methods, Cattell’s scree test is a subjective
            method because the determination of the elbow point in the scree plot requires the
            user to make a judgmental call. Therefore, another purpose of this study is to propose
            a method that may allow for a more objective evaluation of Cattell’s scree test, specifically,
            through calculating angles in the scree plot. A Monte Carlo study was conducted to
            examine the performance of exploratory factor analysis, Kaiser’s rule, parallel analysis,
            and the revised scree test in determining the dimensionality of data when guessing
            effects were present. The following design factors were manipulated: factor structure,
            sample size, test length, the number of factors, values of the pseudo-guessing parameters,
            and the correlation between factors. The study results showed that all four methods
            performed worse for determining the number of factors under the presence of guessing
            effects than under the absence of guessing effect. In other words, none of the four
            methods was robust to the presence of guessing effects. Among the four methods, parallel
            analysis performed the best. The study results also showed that all four methods tended
            to retain fewer factors as the guessing effects became greater. Across all levels
            of guessing effects, parallel analysis was the best method for identifying the number
            of factors under conditions with simple structures, while exploratory factor analysis
            using the chi-square difference test was the best method for determining the dimensionality
            of bifactor models. In terms of the methods for estimating polychoric correlations,
            the maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods performed almost identically and led to
            similar estimated numbers of factors via the four methods. The current study design
            indicated that two different cutoff values were reasonable to use for determining
            the number of factors via the revised Cattell’s scree test: 161 for simple-structure
            models and 173 for bifactor models. The revised Cattell’s scree test performed better
            for determining the number of factors under conditions with simple structures than
            with bifactor models using these two cutoff values. Although practitioners and researchers
            may consider using the revised Cattell’s scree test to evaluate a scree plot in a
            more objective way, it is important to use the indicated cutoff values with caution
            in that they may not be applicable under other study conditions.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation seeks to determine fundamental differences between lanthanides and
            actinides, as well as how their bonding influences ligand selectivity, for possible
            actinide separations from nuclear waste. The f-elements are significantly understudied
            when compared to other parts of the periodic table such as the d-block. Research into
            the f-elements, and more specifically the 5f elements, has undergone a renaissance
            of sorts with steadily increasing interest over the past few decades. It was previously
            predicted that the chemistry for later actinides was identical to that of their lanthanide
            counterparts. However, a review by Neidig et al., “The covalency in f-element complexes”,
            helped introduce the concept of a greater degree of covalency in the actinides than
            in the lanthanides, creating a substantial dividing point for chemists to explore.1
            The goal of this work is to shed further light on how later actinides behave and can
            be utilized. These new findings could help in the design of future separations techniques
            and materials. The first half of my dissertation will focus on the bonding in later
            actinides. I focus on an americium and californium complex [M(EtBTP)3][BPh4]3•3CH3CN
            (M = Am, Cf) (EtBTP = ethyl bistriazinyl pyridine). I also compare the [Am(EtBTP)3]3+
            to its neodymium analog. Structural analysis of these complexes revealed that these
            compounds contain M3+ cations bound by tridentate EtBTP ligands, to create a tricapped
            trigonal prismatic geometry around the metal centers. Collection of high-resolution,
            single crystal X-ray diffraction data also allowed for reduction in bond distance
            estimated standard deviation (esd’s) such that a slight contraction of Δ = 0.0158(18)
            Å in the Am‒N versus Nd‒N bond distances is observed, even though these cations ostensibly
            have matching ionic radii. Theoretical evaluation revealed enhanced metal-ligand bonding
            through back donation in the [Am(EtBTP)3]3+ complex that is absent in [Nd(EtBTP)3]3+.
            The [Cf(EtBTP)3]3+ complex was also compared to its lanthanide analogs, gadolinium
            and erbium. Upon analysis of these complexes, Cf showed significantly stronger bonding
            than Gd and Er. The contractions of some of the Cf bonds with the nitrogen atoms on
            EtBTP, revealed that Er could be a better analog for Cf complexes that are expected
            to have greater covalent characteristics. These two studies provide new information
            about how Cf and Am bond to ligands, and reveal how they differ from their lanthanide
            analogs. The second half of this dissertation centers on possible applications for
            f-block ligands. The two main points of interest are photochromic properties of [M(EtBTP)3][BPh4]3•3CH3CN
            (M = La, Eu, Gd, Yb) complexes, as well as a dithioamide ligand with possible separations
            applications. The [M(EtBTP)3][BPh4]3•3CH3CN (M = La, Eu, Gd, Yb) complexes exhibit
            a long-lived color change when exposed to intense light. This color change lasts on
            the order of hours, and increases in length as you go across the series. This color
            change is caused by a radical formation upon exposure to light. The long-lived nature
            of this color change is attributed to a trapped triplet excited state, with a relaxation
            that is moderated by the metal center. This shows the versatility of EtBTP and how
            it can be used in possible photochromic materials. The practicality of dithioamides
            as ligands for separations has yet to be greatly understood. The dithioamides were
            compared to their diamide counterparts, and the dithioamides showed greater selectivity
            for AmIII over EuIII. This selectivity is due to the softer donor properties of the
            sulfur atoms. This study showed the merit of studying other sulfur donor ligand systems
            for use in actinide extractions.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Estimation of functions is an extremely rich and well-researched topic of research
            with broad applications spanning several scientific fields. We develop a shape based
            framework for probability density and general function modelling. The framework encompasses
            both shape constrained and unconstrained estimation, and can accomodate a much broader
            notion of shape constraints than has been considered in literature. The estimation
            approach is a two step process where the first step creates a template or an initial
            guess, and the second important step ``improves" the estimate according to an appropriate
            objective function. We derive asymptotic properties of the estimators in different
            scenarios, and illustrate the performance of the estimate through several simulation
            as well as real data examples.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Mathematical thinking is in high demand in the global market, but compared to their
            international peers, U.S. school children fail to meet math performance benchmarks.
            This is especially problematic, given that early math skills predict later success
            in math and reading, beyond the effects of early reading skills and that math difficulties
            prior to formal schooling make it unlikely that children who start off behind will
            catch up. The home math environment (HME), which includes all math-related activities,
            attitudes, expectations, resources, and interactions between parents and children
            in the home, provides a potentially promising way to promote children’s early math
            development. In order to understand the role played by the HME in children’s math
            abilities, the a pre-registered meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the average
            weighted correlation coefficient, r between the HME and children’s math achievement
            and the sample, assessment, and study features that contribute to study heterogeneity.
            A multilevel correlated effects model was run on 51 studies and a total of 456 effect
            sizes, which found a positive, significant average weighted correlation of r = .14,
            p &lt; .0001. Although the association found was low in magnitude, our combined sensitivity
            analyses showed that the present findings were robust, and that the sample of studies
            has evidential value. Interestingly, moderator analyses revealed that all moderators
            tested contributed to study heterogeneity and when the HME component moderation analyses
            were run, no significant between-study heterogeneity remained.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>High temperature superconductors (HTS) allow for the construction of magnets generating
            fields of more than 30 T, enabling the investigation of new phenomena in condensed
            matter science and high energy physics. High field magnets store large amounts of
            energy that must be dissipated if the field collapses, but HTS materials require large
            quantities of heat for transitioning to the normal state. This makes HTS conductors
            very stable against fluctuations, yet difficult to protect from extreme temperature
            rise in the case that something generates a propagating normal or resistive zone in
            the magnet, i.e. quenches the superconductor. As HTS conductor is much more expensive
            than normal conductors or low temperature superconductors (LTS), protecting even prototype
            research coils and especially large-scale user solenoids and accelerator dipoles is
            paramount. Recently, a quench protection system relying on interfilament coupling
            currents within superconductors has been developed with LTS magnet systems. Coupling-loss
            induced quench (CLIQ) protection attempts to safely distribute the stored energy of
            a superconducting magnet over a larger volume by quickly bringing a significant fraction
            into the normal state by introducing oscillating currents into sections of the magnet
            generating heat due to the rapidly varying magnetic field. As HTS have larger energy
            margins to the normal state, in addition to different AC loss characteristics and
            conductor geometries, experiments and simulations are underway to evaluate and optimize
            AC loss induced quench for each conductor. Addressing the pressing need for reliable
            high field HTS magnets, presented here are the results for implementing these systems
            in magnets made from Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x (Bi-2212), which is the practical HTS most similar
            to LTS in both single strand and cable designs. Recent advances in the current carrying
            capacity of Bi-2212 (&gt;1000 A mm^-2 at 5 T) due to improved starting powder and over-pressure
            heat treatment make this HTS appealing for large-scale magnet projects. Long sample
            conductor property measurements are underway to investigate if Bi-2212 has consistent
            electrical and mechanical properties along its length. Collaboration between the National
            High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL)
            has allowed for testing on world-record sub-scale accelerator dipoles and test coils
            for a program working towards generating more than 1 GHz NMR spectra and fields in
            excess of 30 T.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Limited research has examined the gesture use of young children with and without autism
            spectrum disorder (ASD) in a home-based setting. Observation in the natural environment
            can supplement assessments that take place in structured clinical contexts and may
            provide useful information about a child’s strengths and needs and the family’s preferred
            activities and intervention priorities. This study documented the rates and relative
            frequencies of communicative acts, with a special focus on gestures, used by a sample
            of 211 toddlers who participated in everyday activities with a caregiver during a
            video recorded home observation at around 20 months of age. Participants were identified
            through prospective screening in the general population and diagnosed at approximately
            age 3 with ASD, non-ASD developmental delays (DD), or typical development (TD). Group
            differences were found on several measures of communication, including types of communicative
            acts, modes of communication used, and communicative functions expressed. Children
            with ASD, DD, and TD were observed to differ significantly on overall rate of communication
            during the home observation. Children with ASD used deictic gestures, non-word vocalizations,
            gesture + vocalization combinations, and communicative acts for behavior regulation
            at significantly lower rates than children with DD and TD. Rates of communication
            across different everyday activities in the home environment generally followed patterns
            of overall rate, with some exceptions. Statistically significant concurrent and predictive
            associations were observed between communicative acts at home and archival measures
            of social communication, developmental level, adaptive behavior, and autism symptoms.
            Finally, inventory of gestures was observed to have significant relationships with
            all archival measures. Results of this study have implications for both early identification
            of and early intervention for children with communication delays and ASD.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The aim of the present study was to complete a scoping review of current research
            on adolescent vocabulary intervention across settings in order to develop a nascent
            conceptual framework for oral and written, expressive and receptive adolescent vocabulary
            intervention. Such a tool could be beneficial for speech-language pathologists (SLPs)
            and teachers to utilize as they address the vocabulary, language, and literacy needs
            of diverse students in unique settings. Synthesis was completed first through a multiple
            database search of literature between 2003 and 2018. Studies were narrowed down from
            811 to 17 based on inclusion and exclusion criteria and analyzed using a rubric which
            outlined characteristics of the interventions and their service delivery. From this
            information a synthesis and analysis of studies’ commonalities and differences was
            created, and implications were discussed. Some implications include the need for unified
            definitions of vocabulary skill measurement across the field of speech-language pathology,
            the use of multimodal approaches to intervention that incorporate collaboration and
            the reading of each student’s reality, and drawing upon social validity measures in
            order to create more effective interventions. Conclusions, limitations, and future
            research are discussed further, as well as the concept of creating a conceptual framework
            for adolescent vocabulary intervention which could become a tool for SLPs and teachers.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Bipolar disorder is one of the 10 most disabling conditions in the world. As such,
            inpatient hospitalization for individuals with bipolar disorder is far greater than
            hospitalization rates for all other patients with behavioral health diagnoses. Bipolar
            disorder is also associated with reduced lifespans of 9.2 years, and 1 in 5 individuals
            with bipolar disorder die by suicide. Such statistics are alarming and illuminate
            the impact of bipolar disorder on functioning and overall quality of life. However,
            the constructs of self-efficacy, social support, and age of onset may impact and lead
            to a decrease in substance use severity (i.e., alcohol and illicit drug use) for individuals
            with a bipolar disorder diagnosis. A sample of 91 participants was recruited from
            bipolar disorder support group websites and blogs for people with bipolar disorder.
            Measures for the current study included the bMAST, DAST-10, GSE, and SSA-S. Research
            questions included (1) Are self-efficacy, age of onset, and social support related
            to alcohol use severity for individuals with bipolar disorder? (2) Are self-efficacy,
            age of onset, and social support related to illicit drug use severity for individuals
            with bipolar disorder? Statistical analyses for the variables included two hierarchical
            multiple linear regressions. Due to violated assumptions for multiple linear regressions,
            a non-parametric analysis was run separately for each research question. No significant
            results were indicated for the research questions included in the study. For both
            ordinal logistic regressions, the models with all predictors (age of onset, self-efficacy,
            and social support) did not significantly improve compared to the intercept only models.
            Results of this study were discussed related to improvement for future research and
            implications for future practice.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Natal dispersal, the period where an organism moves from its birthplace to the area
            where it settles and attempts to breed, may have significant consequences for individual
            fitness. Individuals vary in both the decision to initiate dispersal and the decision
            to settle and attempt reproduction. In cooperative species, some individuals delay
            their departure from the natal territory and forego reproduction for one or more breeding
            seasons, while others disperse much sooner. The timing of when individuals depart
            their natal site can affect their ability to locate and establish a breeding territory.
            Availability of local breeding sites, competition among the natal group, and an individual’s
            development are hypothesized to influence dispersal initiation. Once an individual
            departs the natal territory, they also must choose a settlement area that will affect
            their access to potential mates, resources, and exposure to predators. Understanding
            how a juvenile’s experience prior to dispersal influences their timing and settlement
            decisions may help explain variation in fitness among individuals within a population.
            Despite the importance of settlement site, individuals often appear to settle in low-quality
            habitat when high-quality habitat is available. The Natal Habitat Preference Induction
            hypothesis posits that individuals may choose breeding habitat that is similar to
            their natal habitat, rather than habitat of the highest quality. I investigated factors
            that influenced variation in dispersal behavior in a population of cooperatively breeding
            Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) by addressing two questions: (1) What factors
            influence whether and when individuals depart from the natal territory? and (2) How
            do individuals make settlement decisions? I found that males dispersed earlier when
            they experienced more competition within the natal group, and females dispersed earlier
            when they were smaller in size relative to their siblings, and when local breeding
            opportunities were constrained. I found no evidence that individuals were choosing
            settlement sites based on habitat cues as predicted by the Natal Habitat Preference
            Induction hypothesis. My thesis broadens understanding of how multiple aspects of
            an individual’s experience might affect dispersal decisions, and assesses one hypothesis
            that potentially explains how dispersers make settlement decisions.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) impacts one in every 59 children in the United States
            of America (CDC, 2018). Not only does ASD affect the life of the child, but it also
            impacts the lives of the child’s caretakers. Parental stress related to perceptions
            of symptom severity, the impact of the child’s diagnosis, fear of relapse, social
            stigma, cost of care, and daily stressors of simply having a child can impact the
            psychosocial well-being of the parents (Seltzer et. al., 2009; Woolfson, 2004). Gaining
            insight into coping mechanisms of parents of children with ASD allows the opportunity
            to increase awareness, create individualized intervention approaches, and provide
            families with the care they need. The aim of this dissertation was to explore the
            impact of humor, optimism, and spirituality on the stress levels of parents of children
            with ASD. Specifically, the goal was to determine if the use of the positive psychology
            constructs of humor, optimism, and spirituality were related to parental stress. An
            additional aim of the study was to determine if there were differences in parental
            stress by parental perception of symptom severity. The study examined three specific
            symptom severity levels for this question based upon DSM-V criteria for ASD. To collect
            data, a sample of adults with children with ASD were recruited via social media, then
            surveyed through the Qualtrics survey system. A standard multiple linear regression
            was used to examine whether humor, optimism, and spiritualty could predict parental
            stress. A one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted to determine differences
            between parental perception of symptom severity on parental stress. The 7-item Coping
            Humor Scale (CHS; Lefcourt &amp; Martin, 1986) was used to measure humor. The 10-item
            Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R; Scheier, Carver, &amp; Bridges, 1994) was used to
            measure optimism. The 20-item the Spiritual Well Being Scale (SWBS; Ellison, 1983;
            Ellison &amp; Smith, 1991) was used to measure spirituality. The 36-item Parental Stress
            Index-Short Form (PSI-SF; Abidin, 1995) was used to measure parental stress. Participants
            (n =166) for the study were mostly comprised of females (n = 122) and individuals
            of Caucasian ethnicity (n =101). While mothers primarily represented the sample, there
            was a small representation of males (n = 39). Regarding the child’s diagnosis, ASD
            was most frequently reported (n = 122). The results of the study indicated the use
            of optimism as a positive coping mechanism predicted decreased levels of parental
            stress in parents of children with ASD, with 5.9% of the variance explained. However,
            the use of humor and spirituality were non-significant. The One-way ANOVA indicated
            groups differences between mild severity and severe severity in that those individuals
            with mild symptom severity perceptions experience more parental stress than those
            with severe symptom severity perceptions, with 4.9% of the variance explained. A discussion
            of the findings, limitations of the study, and implications for theory, practice,
            and research are provided.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>As the rate of stroke increases, the rate of aphasia, an acquired impairment of language
            and communication, also increases. Aphasia can result in many impairments, including
            alexia, or acquired reading difficulties. Yet, research in this area is relatively
            sparse. This study aimed to determine the relationships, interactions, and differences
            between oral reading and reading comprehension in 43 individuals with aphasia. Additionally,
            differences between oral reading and reading comprehension within and between alexia
            subgroups were examined. Results indicated a significant relationship between oral
            reading and reading comprehension, with oral reading predicting, to a significant
            degree, overall and single word reading comprehension performance. Results also showed
            overall reading comprehension was significantly better than overall oral reading.
            Regarding reading subgroups in the larger sample, findings included that individuals
            classified as reading within normal limits and those with more mild alexia (i.e.,
            phonological alexia) demonstrated better reading comprehension across all reading
            levels when compared to those with more severe alexia types (i.e., deep and global
            alexia). Our findings regarding the strong relationship between oral reading and reading
            comprehension reinforces literacy theories, especially those of early childhood reading
            development. Our findings regarding differences between and within the alexia groups
            support alexia classifications and the respective impact of severity on reading comprehension.
            These findings are important to research regarding alexia, as the compiled evidence
            is relatively small considering the occurrence of the disorder and may be beneficial
            both academically and clinically regarding reading abilities in individuals with aphasia
            and alexia.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Brain mapping studies the structure and function of the brain through imaging techniques
            in an effort to relate function to specific anatomical regions. The highly folded
            nature of the human brain makes visualization difficult; thus neuroscientists desire
            quantitative methods to assist with characterization of anatomical differences between
            subjects. As cortical folding patterns are unique to each person, methods for quantifying
            differences across subjects are lacking. A first step in quantifying data is to define
            a normal, healthy brain in terms of both shape and function. Establishing spatial
            characteristics of a healthy brain, or an aggregate of healthy brains, will allow
            for better diagnosis and treatment of brain injuries and diseases. The research discussed
            in this thesis uses a two-dimensional, or ``flat", map of the cortical surface based
            on a three-dimensional reconstruction from medical images acquired using magnetic
            resonance imaging. Such mappings can be used to measure cross-subject differences,
            as well as the development of abnormalities in longitudinal studies of diseased patient
            brains. The ``flat" mappings we discuss are constructed using a mathematical approach
            known as circle packing. Our research makes use of conformal mappings and the properties
            preserved under them, defining ways to apply them to brain data. These conformally
            invariant properties take into account aspects of the three-dimensional shape of the
            surface which are not easily visualized, and allow us to quantify them in a two-dimensional
            result. In particular, we develop methods for calculation of extremal length and harmonic
            measure. We also give various forms of visualization of each invariant, and in some
            cases visualization of biological data in conjunction with our calculations. After
            calculating methods of comparison to be used indirectly, we offer two adaptations
            to an existing program which allow for the direct comparison of cortical surfaces.
            The data we use does not fit specific criteria of the program, so these adaptations
            are necessary to generalize the usage of the existing program. We again use the concept
            of circle packing for ``flat" mappings; however, the ingenuity of our adaptations
            lies in the connecting between these ``flat" maps. We follow a procedure for transforming
            the coordinates of a source surface into those of a destination surface, through a
            system of weighting vertices by barycentric or gyrobarycentric coordinates. Though
            our research focuses on a small region of the human brain, we proceed with the expectation
            that all methods can be generalized to other regions of the brain. As many psychological
            disorders have structural manifestations, the research can be used to investigate
            anomalies in brain data for such illnesses. Additionally, the methods we provide can
            be further generalized to surfaces other than the brain, laying groundwork for use
            in general investigations of two and three-dimensional surfaces.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In this study, I re-theorize identity and self-positioning as central focuses of feminist
            composition pedagogy by building a theory of ethos as epistemology within writing
            studies. My study moves ethos beyond a mere rhetorical strategy by posing it as a
            way of knowing. Thus, I analyze the concept of ethos as a feminist way of teaching
            and ultimately present a fuller theory of feminist ethos that draws on ecological
            and epistemic frameworks to re-conceptualize how the ancient concept could be employed
            as a teachable habit within TA preparation programs and within the feminist composition
            classroom. This study contributes to conversations in composition studies, first-year
            composition, feminist rhetorics, and multiculturalism, and in doing so, it seeks to
            foreground the importance of rhetorical knowledge and epistemic diversity within composition
            pedagogy. While the first three chapters of my study present a revitalized theory
            of ethos as epistemology, in the concluding chapters, the project gathers information
            about how Florida State University composition instructors understand and implement
            two things in their college composition classrooms: (1) feminist rhetorical principles;
            and (2) the concept of ethos –understood in pragmatic terms as “tone,” “voice,” “personal
            appeal,” “credibility,” but more recently considered in feminist rhetorical theory
            as an embodied dimension of selfhood that reflects the changing subject positions
            and locations from which all rhetors speak and compose. In short, my project enacts
            a combination of empirical and theoretical methods: first I build a theoretical model
            of ethos as epistemology within writing studies by situating the concept within the
            following theoretical conversations: feminist pedagogy, epistemology, critical race
            theory, intersectionality, and multiculturalism. As I theorize ethos alongside these
            theoretical conversations, I attend to the ways that identity is flattened, especially
            within studies of multiculturalism and intersectionality. Then I collect and analyze
            instructors’ responses to questions about their major epistemological leanings in
            pedagogy and patterns of practice in order to make speculative conclusions about how
            the theoretical model could potentially be taken up within new instructor preparation
            programs. In addition to surveying current FSU composition instructors to trace patterns
            in their understandings of feminist pedagogy, I collect and analyze sets of classroom
            teaching materials (syllabi, assignment sheets, classroom activities) in order to
            consider how instructors create opportunities for students to craft ethos within the
            curricula they build. My study begins from the guiding premise that teachers are learners
            (especially within the learning site of TA preparation), and that premise guides my
            theorizing. From that theorizing, I aim to consider how this model of ethos as epistemology
            could be used within TA preparation specifically to shape those perceptions and misperceptions
            of TAs. Therefore, my interest in teacher perceptions is a motivating interest and
            a potential useful outcome for creating a model of ethos as epistemology within writing
            studies. Considering the implications of this theory-building on TA preparation also
            interrogates the idea of liminality, as pre-service TA preparation is a site of convergence
            for these co-existing identities of teacher and student.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The present study examined personality factors in relation to negative career thoughts
            and profile elevation. Study participants (n = 128) were undergraduate students enrolled
            in five sections of a career development course at a large, public, Southeastern university.
            The NEO Five-Factor Inventory-3 Form S (NEO FFI-3 Form S; McCrae &amp; Costa, 2010) was
            used to measure the five factors of personality (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness,
            Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness). The Career Thoughts Inventory (CTI; Sampson
            et al., 1996a) was used to measure negative career thoughts and the Standard Self-Directed
            Search (StandardSDS; Holland &amp; Messer, 2017) was used to measure profile elevation.
            A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine if the five
            personality factors (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness)
            on the NEO FFI-3 were predictors of negative career thoughts (CTI Total Score). Results
            of the hierarchical multiple regression showed that 27.1% of the variability in the
            CTI Total Score was explained by the combined effect of Neuroticism, Extraversion,
            Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. Neuroticism and Conscientiousness
            were the only statistically significant predictors of the CTI Total Score. In addition,
            a simple linear regression was conducted to determine if negative career thoughts
            (CTI Total Score) predicted profile elevation on the StandardSDS. The simple linear
            regression results showed that 3.6% of the variance in profile elevation could be
            explained by the CTI Total Score. Finally, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis
            was conducted to determine if the five personality factors (Neuroticism, Extraversion,
            Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness) on the NEO FFI-3 and negative career
            thoughts (CTI Total Score) predicted profile elevation on the StandardSDS. The hierarchical
            regression revealed that 38.0% of the variability in profile elevation was explained
            by Openness, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, CTI Total Score, and Agreeableness.
            Openness was found to be the strongest predictor of profile elevation, followed by
            Agreeableness, Conscientiousness as the third strongest, and Extraversion as the fourth
            strongest predictor of profile elevation. Additional analyses showed that 7.9% of
            the variance in profile elevation could be explained by DMC. Additional analyses also
            revealed a significant positive relationship between Neuroticism and DMC, as well
            as significant negative relationships among DMC, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness.
            A significant positive correlation was found between Neuroticism and CA, as well as
            a significant negative correlation between Conscientiousness and CA. Finally, a significant
            positive correlation was found between Neuroticism and EC, as well as significant
            negative correlations among EC and Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness.
            A discussion of the study’s findings and limitations are offered. Lastly, implications
            for theory, practice, and future research are included.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Previous research has shown rapid serial naming to be predictive of reading fluency,
            although the mechanisms underlying this connection are much less established. Despite
            the strong relationship with rapid serial naming (RAN), oral reading fluency is much
            less predicted by isolated naming (IN). Since the requirements involved in completing
            these tasks are similar, yet differ in their predictive abilities, the sources of
            this predictive power must lay in the differences between these tasks. The present
            study investigates these differences to attempt to determine the specific underlying
            processes that make rapid serial naming predictive of reading fluency. Results showed
            no significant difference in correlation with the addition of an underline to a RAN
            task to help keep track of the current location and location tracking did not mediate
            the relationship between RAN and ORF suggesting that individual differences in location
            tracking abilities may not explain the relationship between RAN and ORF. Furthermore,
            no significant difference in correlation was observed between ORF and IN and ORF and
            either of the cluttered IN tasks. This suggests that the cluttered visual scene may
            not explain the difference in ability to predict ORF between IN and RAN. Lastly, no
            difference in correlation with ORF was observed for three different IN gap sizes.
            Implications of these unexpected findings are discussed.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Metal flux synthesis is a useful technique for the discovery of novel intermetallic
            phases. The molten state enhances diffusion rates which improves rates of reaction.
            Reactions can proceed at lower temperatures, allowing for the observation of metastable
            phases. The technique also allows favorable conditions for single crystal growth.
            In this work, two mixed metal fluxes were explored. The first was a Pr/Ni binary mixture
            in a 3:1 ratio, melting at a temperature of 525 °C. The mixture acted as a solvent
            for iron and other transition metals to react with main group elements. The second
            was a binary La/Ni eutectic 67% rich in lanthanum, m.p. 517 °C. This latter flux was
            used to grow an intermetallic carbide using anthracene as a reactant. Reactions of
            silicon and phosphorus with iron and carbon in the Pr/Ni binary mixture produced phases
            of the new structure type Pr62Fe21M16C32 (M = Si, P) in the P4/mmm space group (a
            = 15.584(2) Å, c = 11.330(1) Å for the Si analog). These compounds have a zeolite-like
            iron carbide framework of corner-sharing FeC3 subunits filled with a cationic Pr/M
            network. Building blocks in the structure were found to be in common with those in
            Pr21Fe8Si7C12, a new analog of the previously reported La21Fe8Sn7C12. Magnetic susceptibility
            measurements and band structure calculations for Pr62Fe21Si16C32 indicate that the
            iron atoms in the compound are not magnetic; the low temperature complex antiferromagnetic
            ordering is due to the Pr3+ ions. Conversely, both iron and praseodymium moments contribute
            to the magnetic behavior of Pr21Fe8Si7C12. Pr/Ni flux reactions with tellurium, iron
            and boron resulted in the intermetallic phase with new structure type Pr21Fe16Te6B30
            in the cubic space group P-43m (a = 10.61709 Å). Initially, the phase appeared to
            grow in the Pm-3m space group, but bond length analysis indicated the growth of the
            phase was subject to twinning. The P-43m local structure was verified by TEM measurements.
            The phase features Fe16B30 clusters composed of an Fe16 Friauf polyhedron surrounded
            by a complex network of boron atoms. Adjacent Fe16B30 clusters are bridged by boron-boron
            dimers and are surrounded by a cationic Pr/Te network. Both the praseodymium ions
            and the iron contribute to the effective magnetic moment of this compound. Reactions
            of iron and anthracene in a La/Ni flux produced the new metal carbide La15(FeC6)4H.
            Anthracene acts as a carbon and hydrogen source. The presence of hydride in the product

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Individuals engage in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) to decrease intense negative
            emotions. Notably, self-injurers are more likely to engage in NSSI in the context
            of certain emotions (i.e., anger, rejection, guilt). This may be partially explained
            by the fact that anger is related to increased physiological arousal relative to other
            emotions (i.e., sadness). However, this hypothesis has yet to be tested among those
            who engage in NSSI. The current study addressed gaps in the literature regarding the
            effect of specific emotions on physiological arousal and pain perception by inducing
            several emotional states, including anger, sadness, happiness, and a neutral emotion.
            Hypotheses were tested among 92 females with a history of NSSI. The hypotheses that
            participants in the anger condition would have the highest physiological arousal during
            the emotion induction and following pain offset was not supported. Additionally, the
            hypothesis that individuals in the anger condition (relative to the other emotion
            conditions) would have significantly higher pain threshold, pain tolerance, and pain
            endurance, and significantly decreased pain threshold intensity was also not supported.
            The current investigation is the first study to examine the interplay between emotions,
            arousal, and pain among those who engage in NSSI and has several implications.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The linker of the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) protein complex bridges the
            inner and outer nuclear membranes and regulates a range of nuclear activities that
            include telomere tethering and chromosome movement. The canonical LINC complex is
            composed of a pair of transmembrane-domain proteins, with the KASH protein localized
            to the outer nuclear membrane, and the SUN protein to the inner nuclear membrane.
            In budding yeast, Csm4, which is specific to meiosis, and Mps2 are two KASH-like proteins,
            whereas Mps3 is the sole SUN protein. The current notion posits that Mps3 pairs with
            either Csm4 or Mps2 to form separate LINC complexes at the telomere and the centrosome,
            respectively. Here we show that Mps2 mediates the interaction between Csm4 and Mps3
            to form a functional heterotrimeric composition of LINC complex that regulates telomere
            attachment and meiotic recombination. Csm4 binds to Mps2, and both localize to telomeres.
            Csm4's localization depends on Mps2 and Mps3, but Mps2's association with the telomere
            depends on Mps3 but not Csm4. The Mps2-mediated heterotrimeric LINC complex controls
            nuclear shape, telomere bouquet formation, recombination, and homolog pairing in prophase
            I. These findings reveal the heterotrimeric composition of the yeast LINC complex
            and have implications for understanding LINC variants in higher eukaryotes. To further
            characterize the heterotrimeric LINC complex, we have reconstructed the meiotic LINC
            complex in vegetative yeast cells by ectopically expressing Csm4. In the wild-type
            cells, both Mps2 and Mps3 are concentrated at the centrosome. In the presence of Csm4,
            Mps2 and Mps3 form “mitotic patches” at the leading edge of the budding daughter cell
            during mitosis. Importantly, the presence of Mps3 patch depends on Mps2, while the
            presence of Mps2 patch does not depend on Mps3, demonstrating that Mps3’s interaction
            with Csm4 requires Mps2. Furthermore, we show that the Mps2/Mps3 patch is absent in
            yeast cells treated with the actin depolymerizing drug latrunculin B, indicating that
            ectopic t-LINC formation in vegetative cells depends on actin. These findings support
            our meiotic model in which the yeast telomere-associated LINC complex is composed
            of Mps3, Mps2, and Csm4. Finally, we have revealed that Csm4 is a short-lived protein,
            whose degradation appears to regulate meiotic telomere-associated LINC complex disassembly.
            The protein level of Csm4 peaks during prophase I but is barely detectable by Western
            blotting after metaphase I. We hypothesize that the disassembly of the yeast telomere-associated
            LINC complex is regulated by the degradation of Csm4. To test this hypothesis, a targeted
            genetic screen was performed and two CSM4 interacting factors were identified, UBC7
            and DOA10, which encode the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and the E3 ligase of the
            endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway, respectively.
            These findings therefore provide a clue to how the yeast telomere-associated LINC
            complex is downregulated during the cell cycle. In summary, we show that a heterotrimeric
            LINC complex is assembled at the telomere in budding yeast meiosis, and Mps2 is the
            linker between Mps3 and Csm4. Our work not only clarifies the composition and function
            of the telomere-associated LINC complex in budding yeast, but also provides implications
            for LINC variant formation in other organisms. In addition, we show that the KASH-like
            protein Csm4 is likely subject to ERAD pathway regulation for protein turnover, which
            may provide a mechanism for LINC complex disassembly during the cell cycle.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In this manuscript, I explore issues of masculinity, mental illness, and spirituality—often
            using the form of elegy. Many of the elegies in this manuscript are in conversation
            with critic Jahan Ramazani’s arguments about elegies: “the modern elegist tends not
            to achieve but to resist consolation, not to override but to sustain anger, not to
            heal but to reopen the wounds of loss.” The arc of the book shows the speaker working
            through grief, healing from loss, and confronting mental illness. The poems of healing
            interrogate that “wound of loss” Ramazani describes, while detailing the inherent
            difficulty of opening or closing the wound. The book is structured in four sections,
            with each section having the central threads braided throughout. Each braid connects
            back to—and is filtered through—the speaker: his struggle with God, his constant conflicts
            with the father figure, his romantic relationships, and his own crumbling mental health.
            In addition to these recurring themes, I attempt to explore the distances between
            two people (or figures), in either a literal way, or through memory. In reckoning
            with those distances, the focus of exploration twists inward: the poems about other
            people become about the speaker. The knowledge gained from the focus inward becomes
            become holes in the speaker’s perceived identity that the poems must then work their
            way out of. Several of my poems are influenced by a strained relationship with an
            emotionally and physically abusive father. This father figure informs my speaker’s
            sense of masculinity through notions of power and love, which becomes mirrored in
            the speaker’s tenuous relationship toward God throughout the manuscript. In the poems
            that deal directly with family, I write in the tradition of such contemporary poets
            as Sharon Olds. However, many of the poems in this manuscript don’t glorify the body
            and the sensuous relationship a person can have with their body, as many of Olds’
            poems do. Instead, many poems look at the way the body breaks down and is impacted
            through chronic illness, inherited conditions, aging, and ultimately, death. Many
            of the poems in this manuscript filter claustrophobic human experiences and interactions
            through the self, attempting to navigate new knowledge that fractures one’s understanding
            of the world. My speaker’s encounters with intimacy tend to reveal the erotic to be
            just as claustrophobic as the self. The poems dealing with intimacy are written in
            the tradition of such poets as Robert Creeley (with his unresolved desire of his idealized
            lover) and Richard Siken (with his attempts to revive and reanimate the dead lover
            in Crush). Several poems attempt to reconstruct memories and fail, thereby giving
            the reader the sense that the speaker is always already aware that memories—even traumatic
            or closely held memories—degrade over time. The end of the manuscript shows the speaker
            working toward recovery from his mental illness, but it doesn’t present that healing
            process in an unrealistic way, knowing that the healing process is never complete.
            Rather, the ending shows the speaker struggling to move forward, but moving forward
            nonetheless.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>My dissertation involves the study of sovereign debt flows with an emphasis on the
            determinants and characteristics of sovereign default in emerging markets, accounting
            for the partial nature of this default. It consists of three chapters: Firstly, Chapter
            One and Chapter Two empirically explore the determinants of sovereign default. Secondly,
            Chapter Three quantitatively investigates the macroeconomic implications of the partial
            nature of sovereign default. In Chapter One and Chapter Two, I empirically examine
            the monetary and default responses of sovereign countries to the fluctuations in world
            commodity prices in a panel of 21 emerging countries with annual observations from
            1970 to 2013, constructing and using a country-specific commodity price index with
            time-varying weights. The selection of the sample countries is based on both the definition
            of an emerging market by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the available information
            of the external public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt arrears in the World Development
            Indicators (WDI) database. It is commonly known that emerging markets are vulnerable
            to global shocks, such as the shocks to world commodity prices. Large fluctuations
            in world commodity prices over the business cycles can greatly affect their foreign
            revenues, causing excessive external imbalances in international payments. Countries
            with external imbalance, especially with excessive current account deficits, are most
            likely to experience limited spending due to constraints on the inter-temporal substitution
            in expenditure and are likely to default on their external debt denominated in foreign
            currencies. I choose world commodity prices as the main predictor for the monetary
            and default responses to investigate, because for many of the countries in the sample,
            commodities are a large proportion of their export and foreign revenues. Large fluctuations
            in commodity prices, causing external imbalance, greatly affect their ability to service
            the external debt, which is typically denominated in foreign currencies. Chapter One,
            “World commodity prices, money, and foreign exchange in emerging markets: New evidence”,
            investigates countries’ monetary responses (the change of broad money and the choice
            of exchange rate regimes) when they are encountering the foreign revenue reduction
            caused by the fluctuations in world commodity prices, before making the decision to
            default. The estimated results show that the declines in world commodity prices significantly,
            positively affect the ratio of broad money to GDP and that countries tend to have
            more flexible exchange rate regimes when world commodity prices are depressed for
            an extended period. The investigation of the response of the broad money supply is
            consistent with the open economy trilemma and the estimates of the exchange rate regime
            flexibility fills the gap of the literature on the determinants of the choice of exchange
            rate regimes. By capturing the type of global shock as well as the time-varying country
            characteristics, the effect of the price index (excluding the country fixed effect)
            well explains the time-series variation and country-specific variation of the exchange
            rate regimes. Chapter Two, “World commodity prices and partial default in emerging
            markets: An empirical analysis”, mainly explores the effects of the fluctuation in
            world commodity prices on sovereign default. The results show that the decrease in
            the price index increases the default rate. The response of the default rate varies
            across countries and it generally increases with a country’s dependence on the commodity
            exports and external indebtedness. This chapter provides the first economically-significant,
            quantitative estimates of the effect of world commodity prices on the default rate.
            A few unique features of my approach allow me to make this contribution: The first
            feature is the price index. In this chapter, the details of developing the novel country-specific
            commodity price index are given. The price index is constructed with a two-stage aggregation
            using time-varying weights based on commodities exported and is used as the main explanatory
            variable. By accounting for the changes in export structure, the time-varying weights
            allow me to use data for a longer period, from 1970 to 2013, for my analysis, covering
            the emerging markets debt crisis, currency crisis, and the recent contraction. This
            country-specific nature of the price index helps control for other common, global
            shocks in the estimation. The second feature is that I focus on the realized default
            risk and use the partial default rate, other than default events, country spreads,
            or credit ratings, as the proxy for that risk. Along with the price index, the default
            rate provides longer-period data and allows me to do the analysis starting from 1970.
            In Chapter Three, “Sovereign debt: A quantitative comparative investigation of the
            partial default mechanism”, I build and quantitatively solve the partial default models
            of a small open economy, in both endowment and production environments, to investigate
            the responses of the borrowing, default, and pricing of sovereign debt to economic
            shocks and to examine how the partial default mechanism improves the predictions of
            the sovereign default models. The simulation results of the models can well predict
            the country spreads, default-related statistics, and other business cycle indicators.
            My models assume the non-exclusion from the international capital market after default.
            Thus, I can also examine the impulse responses of various macroeconomic variables
            to the shocks to better understand the underlying propagation mechanism of partial
            default. The un-realistic assumptions and the limited prediction performance of full
            default models are the two main reasons that motivate me to choose the partial default
            mechanism and to build the partial default models. Firstly, the standard theory of
            sovereign default assumes that countries always default on all of their debt and are
            excluded from the international capital market after default. However, the empirical
            regularities show that countries always default on only part of their debt and they
            continue to borrow while having debt arrears. Besides being inaccurate assumptions,
            the full default model has the limitations in terms of predicting some of the critical
            debt indicators, like the debt-to-output ratio and the default frequency, although
            it can predict that default happens in bad times and can predict counter-cyclical
            country spreads. The partial default models can improve the predictions of the debt
            level and the default frequency without losing the performance of matching other data
            moments. Moreover, it also can predict the partial default rate, which the full default
            model is not designed to and cannot predict. The partial default models in Chapter
            Three have three features: firstly, the partial default is endogenously-determined,
            which allows me to compute the default rate; secondly, there is a preemptive recovery
            payment of the default, which enables the price function of the short-term debt to
            have the feature that the price of the long-term debt has; and thirdly, there is no
            exclusion from the international capital market after default, so I can examine the
            impulse responses of various macroeconomic variables. Compared with the partial default
            model with endowment, the partial default model with production generates better predictions
            for the debt service and improves the over-predicted volatilities of consumption and
            interest spreads. Besides simultaneously matching the mean spread and the debt-to-output
            ratio, its simulated results can predict the pro-cyclical investment and closely match
            the relative volatility of investment.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>International aid agencies and policymakers over the last several decades have sought
            strategies and policies to support education for girls throughout the world. Despite
            significant interventions from world aid organizations, non-governmental agencies,
            and individual countries, more than half of children not attending school are girls.
            Girls’ transition rate from primary to secondary education has been especially alarming
            in sub-Saharan Africa: close to 50% of children do not matriculate from primary to
            secondary school in Africa. In some countries, the numbers have been even higher.
            As of 2013, less than 20% of Tanzanian children continued on to the secondary level
            of education (UNESCO, 2013). In this dissertation, I explored factors and processes
            at an all-girls’ boarding school in rural Tanzania that supported students’ high performance
            on national exams as well as high retention and graduation rates. Drawing upon in-depth
            interviews, this research illustrated how teachers, administrators, and graduates
            of this school defined, approached, and made sense of factors that made this particular
            girls’ education program a success.

            her engagement of the Inter-war émigré Russian community of Montparnasse, Paris as
            well as the broader French public. This paper begins with a detailed account of the
            Inter-war Russian community of Montparnasse, Paris to provide historical context and
            evaluate existing research on the Russian émigré community. A traditionally held notion
            that the community was closed off from outside influence and unified ideologically
            will be dispelled as part of an effort to illustrate how the setting in which Irène
            Némirovsky worked and lived facilitated her ability to write and qualifies her as
            an appropriate subject for study of Russian émigré literature. It also serves a crucial
            role in providing context when analyzing her more controversial works such as “David
            Golder”. Subsequently, an analysis of the scholarly work on Irène Némirovsky is conducted
            followed by an analysis of three of her most well-known novels. Study of these novels
            prove that Némirovsky was an atypical émigré in some ways but typical in others, but
            that above all, the community of Russian Montparnasse held a symbiotic relationship
            with its French host and a free exchange of literary ideas and cultures was available
            if it were sought after.

            and they provide valuable insights into astrophysics and cosmology. One method of
            studying galaxy clusters - the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich Effect - involves using the Cosmic
            Microwave Background (CMB) as a backlight. As CMB photons pass through the hot electron
            gas of the intracluster medium, a small portion are scattered and gain energy. This
            causes a distortion in the spectrum of the CMB which depends mainly on the total mass
            of the galaxy cluster and is independent of redshift, making it an important means
            of probing high-redshift systems. Only recently have telescopes become sensitive enough
            to detect the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect for low masses. In this thesis, we discuss
            the work done using the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect to study low-mass galaxy clusters
            and to identify new galaxy clusters in CMB maps.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation establishes an original solution for allocating populations onto
            networks, which is demonstrated through empirical examples within the comprising census
            geographies of a single census tract and the comprising census geographies for an
            entire county. The novel method, populated polygons to networks (pp2n), is shown to
            perform as accurately as a current state-of-the-art method, while being less computationally
            complex. Benchmark datasets are utilized to represent household-level population distributions.
            Datasets generated from the methods of network allocation are applied to optimal facility
            location modeling scenarios. Networks are an underlying part of the human experience
            and, as such, attention must be given to their study in the spatial analysis of anthropocentric
            phenomena. However, transformations in spatial data must frequently be performed in
            order to allow for the integration of original disparate data formats. Such is often
            the case with spatial population data, which are generally available as polygons.
            As a means to build network-based models for analysis, certain methods have been developed
            for allocating populations onto networks for the purpose of calculating origin-to-destination
            cost (distance) matrices. Two of these methods include (1) simply snapping polygon
            centroids onto the nearest network segment and (2) dividing population values by area
            and proximity to the network. Here the new method, pp2n, is proposed that incorporates
            the strengths of both the existing methods, while mitigating their weaknesses. The
            traditional approach, the state-of-the-art approach, and the pp2n method are tested
            against a benchmark dataset representing population-weighted estimates for property
            parcels. It is shown that the pp2n method is less computationally complex in the worst-case
            scenario than the current state-of-the-art method and more representationally accurate
            that the traditional method. Further, in an empirical example within one census tract
            in Leon County, FL, the pp2n method is found to perform with comparable accuracy to
            the state-of-the-art approach when compared to both the traditional approach and the
            benchmark dataset. Also, it is shown that the algorithm for generating pp2n population
            weights runs in significantly less realtime. Extending the empirical example within
            a single census tract (and comprising geographies), another complete empirical example
            is performed on the full spatial extent of Leon County, Florida. Here the focus shifts
            from purely how the population data are being allocated to the network, to validating
            the spatial data utilized in modeling and understanding the inherent associated uncertainty.

            (MAF), was granted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Within this study, the MAF functions
            as an ultimate gold-standard benchmark to test all the methods used in this dissertation
            within the context of the 2010 Decennial Census. Disclosure and privacy are discussed
            and a critique is given for the method used to produce the population-weighted estimates
            for property parcels. It is then shown, as in the single census tract example, that
            the pp2n method performs as well as the state-of-the-art method, while doing so in
            substantially less runtime. Further, the property parcel dataset is validated as an
            acceptable surrogate for true housing units available from the MAF. Facility location
            modeling is utilized to determine the effects of the network allocation methods on
            optimal site selection. Following a review of mathematical programming and the uncertainty
            involved in spatial optimization, the network allocation methods are tested with four
            fundamental models within a spatial optimization framework: the location set covering
            problem, maximal covering location problem, p-median problem, and p-center problem.
            The linear integer programs are solved for each model, for each method at each spatial
            extent with 15 sets of parameters. In total, 780 models are solved to optimality.
            The results of the abstract population representation models are compared again to
            the population-weighted estimates for property parcels, which act as a surrogate for
            the benchmark truth of census microdata. Results show that the method of network allocation
            has a non-negligible effect on the solutions to facility location models. Specifically,
            optimal facility configurations of the location models are affected within the selected
            spatio-temporal study area: 2010 Leon County, FL.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Legged locomotion is advantageous on difficult natural terrains due to it only requiring
            discrete ground contacts. Biological systems with limbs have developed multiple levels
            of control to afford such fast and robust legged locomotion. Similarly, bio-inspired
            controls on legged robots can also be divided into equivalent levels. The high-level
            controllers, including the brain and the reflex level controllers, process the environmental
            information and communicate with muscles that are denoted as low-level controllers,
            or the preflex level controllers. The low-level controllers then directly contribute
            to dynamics of the legs. Currently, various low-level controllers have been developed
            and shown to have the capability of overcoming rough but certain terrains, i.e. terrains
            with height variation but are infinitely hard. However, uncertain rough terrains universally
            exist in the natural world. To traverse such terrains, the high-level controllers
            need to estimate terrain characteristics and adjust the low-level controllers to accommodate
            the terrain changes as the robots are operating. This dissertation provides the necessary
            techniques to create a feedback control routine to accomplish such high-level tasks
            and achieve terrain-adaptive legged locomotion. It starts from studying the effect
            of leg stiffness and damping on locomotion performance, which necessitates careful
            leg design for successful legged locomotion and advanced low-level leg controllers
            for improved performance. The direct collocation method is then introduced to optimize
            spring modulation trajectories as an advanced leg controller. However, the power of
            the optimization results cannot be sufficiently exploited unless terrain characteristics
            are known beforehand. As a result, the Maximum Entropy method is developed to estimate
            terrain characteristics using data from sensors onboard. This method allows fusion
            of data from heterogeneous sources to obtain objective uncertainty quantification
            of terrain characteristics. With the statistical information about terrain characteristics
            from the Maximum Entropy method, the routine can finally update the low-level leg
            controller such that the robots can survive traversing uncertain rough terrains.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Over the last several decades, Florida has been a destination for immigrants from
            ¬¬around the world, many for whom English is not their first language. In 1990, diverse
            groups of community leaders and activists came together to file a lawsuit against
            the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) to address the need of programs for English
            language learner (ELL) students. As a result of the lawsuit, Florida’s Multicultural
            Education Training and Advocacy (META) Consent Decree provided a framework for compliance
            with federal and state laws and jurisprudence, mandating all districts to ensure ELL
            students are provided with equal access to programming appropriate to their level
            of English proficiency, academic achievement, and special needs. In this dissertation,
            I used a content analysis to systematically investigate the contents of District ELL
            Plans from all 67 school districts in Florida related to their reports regarding their
            engagement in communication and outreach to ELL parents, the functions and composition
            of PLCs and to understand, using Epstein’s Parent Involvement Framework, the nature
            of services to parents. The study focused on the following two sections of the META
            Consent Decree: Section 8 (Parent, Guardian, Student Notification and Rights), and
            Section 9 (The Parent Leadership Council). In my analysis of Section 8, I found that
            districts relied mostly on translated school-to-home communication documents and bilingual
            professionals to communicate with ELL parents. Also, the data showed that districts
            collaborated with various community stakeholders to expand ELL parent and student
            services. As for Section 9, I found that 37% of 67 PLCs (n=25) across the state only
            used PLCs to develop, revise and approve the District ELL Plan while 36% of districts
            used PLCs to provide ELL parents with an opportunity to have a voice and share their
            concerns and needs. In general, 69% of districts implemented their PLCs only at the
            local education agency level, rather than at the school level. Lastly, 100% of the
            districts reported at least one sample practice for Epstein et al.’s (2018) Parent
            Involvement Framework’s through parenting, communicating, volunteering, and decision-making.
            In contrast, 49% of districts did not report a practice for the involvement of families
            through learning at home and 34% of districts did not report a practice deriving from
            the involvement collaborating with the community.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Interservice rivalry between the United States’ military services during the Second
            World War often proved problematic. Although the Americans and their allies emerged
            victorious from the conflict, they did so in part due to the even worse rivalries
            between the military services of the German and Japanese armies. These problems that
            came to a head during the war had a lasting effect on the military structure that
            continues to be felt to this day. The present structure of the American military is
            the result of decades of efforts to unify the services, which culminated with the
            1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act. However, whereas most studies of the subject place the
            Cold War as the central, defining factor of the unification of the defense structure,
            my work argues that it was not tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union
            that created the foundations of the semi-joint American national security state, but
            instead the lessons of the Second World War. The conflicts between the Army and the
            Navy in the Pacific Theater provided the impetus for efforts to unify the services.
            Those same conflicts also led to a much less unified result than had originally been
            hoped for by the proponents of unification, which is, in part, the reason the unification
            process lasted so long after the passage of the National Security Act.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Heat-related mortality rates increase significantly during heat waves, in some instances
            even more than doubling. Climate change projections indicate that the frequency and
            intensity of these extreme heat events may increase. Well-known events such as the
            Chicago 1995 and European 2003 heat wave led to a thorough investigation of the social
            and environmental risk factors that resulted in large numbers of excess mortality.
            However, most studies have focused on outdoor conditions while few published studies
            have attempted to investigate the relationship between heat waves, indoor environments
            and human health. Understanding the role of indoor environments may prove critical
            to reducing heat-related illness, especially in countries such as the U.S. where a
            large proportion of the population spends most of their time indoors. The goal of
            this study is to investigate this relationship and inform future public health studies
            and interventions. Data from the summer of 2016 were compiled for New York City, New
            York, U.S. in order to conduct a case-control study with specific interest in heat-related
            morbidity. Paramedics carried sensors which recorded indoor temperature and relative
            humidity observations while responding to emergency calls. Indoor conditions were
            related to Patient Care Reports containing medical and demographic information of
            the 911 calls provided by the New York City Emergency Medical Services. Additional
            analyses focused on outdoor weather conditions and their effect on indoor conditions
            using weather data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
            National Center for Environmental Information. These data were then compared to the
            data collected indoors to quantify the relationship that exists between outdoor and
            indoor conditions. The study provides insight into two research questions: 1) do outdoor
            conditions relate to indoor conditions, and 2) do indoor temperature and humidity
            relate to the composition of emergency calls. Results from the study show a linear
            relationship between outdoor and indoor temperature and specific humidity. In addition,
            the case-control study results suggest an increased risk of heat-related illness associated
            with temperatures equal to or greater than 28℃.

            typical college students on organizational applications targeting support of executive
            functioning and overall college success. The study utilized a mixed method, exploratory
            design, collecting both qualitative and quantitative data through online surveys and
            web interviews. Student perceptions of organizational apps and individualized consultative
            services were measured, as well as frequency of use and types of apps chosen. Results
            showed that student participants significantly increased how frequently they used
            organizational apps. Students participants reported that they would utilize such services
            again and would refer other students to the services. Aspects that were liked best
            about the services and suggestions for improvement were collected. These results can
            be used to shape future services for neurotypical and neurodiverse college students
            as well as in research to further develop evidence-based supports.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Newly transitioned democracies frequently exhibit authoritarian traits at the subnational
            level. The literature on subnational authoritarianism tends to focus on how these
            enclaves interact with national governments, ignoring how they maintain support in
            their own regions. This dissertation seeks to explain authoritarian persistence in
            the case of Mexico. I propose subnational autocrats maintain their local coalitions
            from the previous autocratic regime. Where they are able to successfully maintain
            these coalitions through economic and political shocks they can persist indefinitely
            into a nationally democratic regime. My empirical analysis looks specifically at Mexico,
            where organized labor remained an important supporter of the Institutional Revolutionary
            Party well after the democratic transition. I use data on organized labor mobilization,
            PRI electoral support, and social spending to see if there is an electoral and social
            spending connection between organized labor and the PRI. I find no clear evidence
            that labor served as a critical player in local electionsfor the PRI.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Mexico and Central America (Mesoamerica) are situated in a complex and unique geographical
            position with the Caribbean Sea to the East and the tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean
            to the West. The weather patterns of this region are driven by winds, temperatures,
            moisture, and orography of several mountain ranges. This study finds the dates of
            the onset and demise of rainfall regimes on a specific day using NASA’s Tropical Rainfall
            Measuring Mission (TRMM) rainfall for years 1998-2012, area-averaged over land. Using
            NASA’s MERRA-2 Reanalysis data, we also look at the phenomenology of the triggers
            of the rainy season onset and demise on the daily time-scale instead of the monthly
            scales used by previous studies. We find that the Mesoamerican Rainy Season can be
            distinguished into two parts: the Early Spring Rainfall (ESR) associated with light
            rains and the Late Spring Rainfall (LSR) associated with heavy rains. Two algorithms
            are used to obtain these rainy season distinctions. A new algorithm was developed
            during this study, called the SLOPE algorithm, to calculate when the rain rates first
            start to increase. In the second method, the daily cumulative anomalies of rainfall
            are compared to the climatological rainfall to find the time of onset of the heavy
            rains, called the MINCA algorithm. To better understand the phenomenology associated
            with the timing of the rainfall, we look at the monsoon trough, moisture flux convergence,
            moist static energy anomalies, and the weakening/strengthening of the winds associated
            with the Caribbean Low-Level Jet and Panama Jet. The light rain rates begin, on average,
            in mid-March, approximately one month after the peak of the winter Caribbean Low-Level
            Jet and the Panama Jet. The ramp-up between the light rains and heavy rains is associated
            with a significant weakening of both jets and the northward progression of a monsoon
            trough off the western coast of Central America. The heavy rain rates begin, on average,
            in mid-May, and are associated with the timing when the Panama Jet goes to near zero
            magnitude and a strong monsoon trough in the eastern Pacific. At the demise of the
            rainfall, approximately in mid-November, the Panama Jet strengthens again, the total
            moisture flux convergence decreases significantly, and the monsoon trough retreats
            southward and eastward. The results of this study have positive implications in agriculture
            and water resources for Mesoamerica, as this information may help resource managers
            better plan and adapt to climate variability.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton to Cytoskeleton) complex is an essential multi-protein
            structure spanning the nuclear envelope in all eukaryotic organisms. The core of the
            LINC complex is comprised of SUN (Sad1/Unc-84) domain proteins in the inner nuclear
            membrane, physically interacting in the periplasmic space, with the KASH (Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne
            homology) domain proteins of the outer nuclear membrane. The N-terminus of SUN domain
            proteins interact with chromatin and lamin or lamin-like proteins at the nuclear periphery,
            whereas, the N-terminus of KASH domain proteins interact with the cytoskeletal components
            in the cytoplasm, making a bridge across the nuclear envelope. LINC complex is essential
            for maintaining the shape and size of the nucleus; nuclear migration; and chromosome
            movements during meiosis. Despite of being an essential component of the cell, the
            knowledge of LINC complex is limited in plants, especially in monocots which include
            grasses, the most important agronomic crops. To fill this knowledge gap, using bioinformatic
            and biochemical approaches, we identified 17 new maize candidate genes coding for
            core LINC or associated proteins. These include 10 Maize LINC KASH (MLK) proteins,
            3 inner nuclear membrane Nuclear envelope Associated Proteins (NEAP), 2 lamin functional
            homologs NMCP/CRWN homolog (NCH) proteins and 2 NCH-interacting KAKU proteins. Several
            of these candidates have been verified for their nuclear envelope localization and
            SUN-interaction by FRAP and co-immunoprecipitation assays in heterologous expression
            system. In previous studies from our lab, 5 SUN proteins were identified in maize
            and SUN2 was characterized for its meiotic functions in tethering telomeres to the
            nuclear envelope, while the KASH protein remained unknown. In second part of the dissertation,
            I have reported the functional characterization of Maize LINC KASH AtSINE-like2, MLKS2,
            which encodes a SINE-group KASH protein with characteristic armadillo repeats (ARM)
            at its N-terminus. Genetic analysis of transposon-insertion mutations, mlks2-1 and
            mlks2-2, showed defects in multiple aspects of meiosis. 3D cytology of mutant meiocytes
            show defects in nuclear positioning, bouquet formation and aneuploidy resulting in
            inviable grains. The mutants show defects in perinuclear actin accumulation. An ARM-dependent
            MLKS2-actin co-localization was observed in heterologous expression system. Together,
            these studies support a working model in which the nucleus is connected to F-actin
            cytoskeleton through a possible VELCRO-type mechanism provided by the MLKS2 ARM-domain
            on the nuclear surface. This places MLKS2 in the meiotic chromosome segregation pathway,
            likely mediated by a chain connecting chromosomes to actin through SUN-MLKS2 LINC
            complex.

            focus is given on how adolescent African American females make sense of STEM education
            in a middle grades’ context. Framed within the situated cognition theory, this study
            explores how young Black females make sense of STEM learning through engaging with
            structured STEM-based activities while participating in one of two different middle
            grades classroom settings. Furthermore, data from one-on-one interviews, task observations,
            and a focus group discussion were triangulated to show how the participants made sense
            of their learning. As a result of this study, participants’ sensemaking of STEM emerged
            in three unique cases and was identified in light of how they defined the acronym
            STEM, how they verbalized and demonstrated the practices used by scientists and engineers,
            and the types of academic resiliency they either referred to or displayed throughout
            the process.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation is comprised of two essays that focus on the role of disposition
            effect to market reactions in seasoned equity offerings and the importance of considering
            the dynamics of reference price in disposition effect. The first essay investigates
            the association between the disposition effect and the stock price reaction to announcements
            of seasoned equity offers (SEOs). I find that SEO issuing firms in which investors
            have greater unrealized capital gains exhibit a more severe SEO announcement reaction.
            This result is consistent with the well-known disposition effect, whereby investors
            tend to sell stocks in which they have unrealized capital gains and hold stocks with
            unrealized losses. I also find supporting evidence that investors’ behavioral biases
            contribute more to SEO announcement reactions for firms with lower institutional ownership.
            The results suggest that the disposition effect can influence SEO announcement reactions.
            In the second essay I study the disposition effect using highest price as a reference
            point. Recent literature shows that investors’ selling propensity is V-shaped with
            respect to unrealized profits, challenging the predicted monotonic relationship. I
            find that such monotonic relationship exists between the selling propensity and the
            perceived return when gains and losses are measured relative to a new reference point:
            the highest price experienced by the investor since purchase. I find consistent evidence
            when using the highest price in the past 52 weeks as a reference point. Further evidence
            shows that stocks with higher perceived returns subsequently underperform. Overall,
            my findings suggest that accounting for the dynamics of the reference point in measuring
            perceived trading profits is crucial for understanding the disposition effect, and
            that the highest-price-based disposition effect may be driven by informed trading.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The interdental fricative /θ/, present in North-Central Spain, has proven to be difficult
            for second language learners to acquire, even after time spent abroad in Spain (Geeslin&amp;
            Gudmestad, 2008; Knouse, 2012). Explicit pronunciation training helps to improve learners’
            pronunciation of the L2 (Ausín &amp; Sutton, 2010; González-Bueno &amp; Quintana-Lara, 2011),
            as does increased exposure to dialectal variation (Schmidt, 2018). Previous research,
            however, has only focused on the production of the interdental fricative /θ/. Contradictory
            evidence related to the order in which sounds are perceived versus produced, calls
            for further investigation of the link between perception and production (Nagle, 2017;
            Chan, 2011). The current study investigates the perception of the Spanish /θ/, and
            the impact of explicit training, proficiency level, and instructor dialect on its
            acquisition. One discrimination and three identification tasks were designed to examine
            learners’ perception of the fricative /θ/. Learners were tasked with identifying two
            stimuli as sounding the same or different, listening to stimuli and writing down what
            they heard, identifying words as native or not native to Spain, and listening to a
            list of words and choosing the correct response from a provided list. Consistent with
            previous studies, it was hypothesized that more advanced learners would better perceive
            the fricative /θ/ than beginners (H1), that learners who received explicit training
            would better perceive the fricative /θ/ than learners without explicit training (H2),
            and that learners with an instructor speaking a Peninsular accent would better perceive
            the fricative /θ/ than learners with instructors from other dialectal areas (H3).
            A total of 102 L2 participants were recruited from beginner, low-intermediate, intermediate,
            and advanced Spanish courses; approximately half received explicit training on the
            use of the /θ/ in Spanish. Half of the participants also had an instructor with a
            Peninsular accent. xiv In addition, 5 native Spanish speakers also participated in
            the study to provide a baseline. The study used a pretest, posttest design and repeated
            measures ANOVAs; significance was set at p≤.05.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Utilizing the historical and cultural frameworks of Stephen Hahn and bell hooks and
            their scholarly predecessors and contemporaries, this study focuses on the African
            Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church in Early County, Georgia, as a counter-hegemonic
            rural space for refuge, resistance, ingenuity and community-building, paying close
            attention to the activities at county seat, Blakely, which rippled through Early County.
            Chapter 1 of this study will examine the historical presence and significance of Blacks
            in Early County and their encounters with Methodism. The writer builds the argument
            that Africans in Early County always exercised varying degrees of ingenuity and autonomy,
            even under the yoke of slavery. As a consequence of the 13th and 14th Amendments,
            Blacks in the county were legally placed in a new space wherein they could make permanent
            inroads and influence AND develop this society. Utilizing the official media organ
            of the AME Church, The Christian Recorder and correspondence from AME Bishops, Elders,
            and laity, the writer shows how the national thrust of the AME church influenced the
            work of freedom and progress at the local level, evidenced through the accomplishments
            and collaborative efforts of AMEs and community leaders in Early County. In order
            for freedom and democracy to expand and be firmly rooted in a community, education
            must be at its core. Chapter 2 examines the AME Church’s role in the field of education
            in Georgia, paying particular attention to African Methodist educational work in Early
            County and its influences across the state. Using the framework of Hooks, the establishment
            of the AME Church --- its educational and political arm created new “worlds” for Blacks
            in Early County. Moreover, it provided a “safe space” for the building of community.
            Chapter 3 will examine the political role of the AME Church in Early County, Georgia,
            highlighting how the firmly-bound ties of the connectional AME church, worked to undermine
            White Supremacy in Blakely, focusing on the leaders of this political movement and
            their religious background and influence. Efforts at Black progress, freedom and autonomy
            in Early County were not met with open arms from the county’s White citizens, at times
            it was met with violent retaliatory measures. Chapter 4 will examine violence in the
            county, analyzing two instances of overt race violence, where AME Churches and congregants,
            among others, were targeted. It will also examine the AME Church’s national stance
            on race violence, highlighting the viewpoint of leaders at the national and local
            levels and how they mitigated polarized race relations at the county seat. Overall,
            this study seeks to add to the historical scholarship of the AME Church’s role in
            Black progress in America. In hooks’ “Choosing the Margin As A Space of Radical Openness”
            she emphasizes a significant line from the South African Freedom Charter which states,
            “Our struggle is also a struggle of memory against forgetting” in her discussion on
            radical politics in the perceived Black peripheral space. It is hoped that this work
            will highlight the efforts of the AME church and Black people in Early County who
            embraced a radical and transformative movement of forward progress, outside of the
            scope of White Supremacy. In addition to this study creating an accurate historical
            record for the halls of academia, this work also encourages readers to remember, identify,
            examine, enhance and reimage the historical tenets of Black political progress and
            implement them to galvanize civic participation, societal justice and inclusive education
            in the rural South.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The debate about student-athlete compensation in college athletics has received increased
            media attention in the past decade. As many parties continue to call for the National
            Collegiate Athletic Association (the NCAA) to reform its organizational model and
            rulebook, commentators have proposed several alternatives to the current amateurism
            model. Among the most commonly discussed is a free market model. This model, arguably,
            would have the most significant impact on the NCAA and its stakeholders. Critics and
            proponents of such a model disagree as to what the impacts would be on the NCAA and
            its ability to achieve its organizational purposes, including governing the fairness
            of competition and establishing rules defining the amateur status of student-athletes
            (Beggs et. al., 2004). The purpose of this study was to investigate managers and stakeholder
            groups’ perceptions of a free market system on the organizational structure and the
            ability of the NCAA to achieve its organizational goals, and the impact on three key
            stakeholders: Division I athletic departments, Division I student-athletes, and sports
            law attorneys. Since much of the current discussion about the future of the NCAA is
            proffered by industry commentators, celebrities, and sports writers, there is a need
            to identify and gain perspective from key stakeholders who would directly affect and
            be affected by a change to the current student-athlete compensation model. Stakeholder
            theory was used as a framework for substantiating the importance of key stakeholders
            in college athletics. Stakeholder theory helps an organization explore the interests,
            expectations and perspectives of those who affect and are affected by its actions
            insomuch a decision maker can accordingly develop appropriate strategies and policies
            for responding to both internal and external influences (Hester, Bradley, &amp; Adams,
            2012). The three stakeholder groups chosen for this study included division I intercollegiate
            athletic administrators, division I student-athletes, and sports law attorneys. These
            stakeholder groups were selected because of their potential to be impacted by the
            implementation of a free market model. By way of understanding the importance of the
            three key stakeholders, this thesis focuses on exploring their perception of: 1) what
            a free market model is for intercollegiate athletics, and 2) how such a free market
            model would potentially impact the development of the NCAA and stakeholders themselves.
            To facilitate the study, semi-structured interviews with eight participants were conducted.
            The participants included two members from each of the above-mentioned stakeholder
            groups (i.e. two division I student-athletes, two sports law attorneys and two division
            I athletic administrators) as well as two NCAA committee members. Those participants
            were chosen through a process of purposive sampling created through a set of specific
            criteria (e.g. only student athletes who played football or basketball were selected
            to participate). Semi-structured interview questions were developed based on the research
            questions listed in this study. All interviews were recorded and participants’ answers
            were transcribed. The transcribed interviews were reviewed and key words and themes
            emerging from the interviews were identified. The data was then analyzed using conventional
            qualitative content analysis. Results of the study revealed that stakeholders of the
            NCAA have varying ideas of what a free market model is for intercollegiate athletics.
            Both NCAA committee members described a free market for intercollegiate athletics
            as a pay-for-play model. The attorneys’ perceptions were related to a traditional
            economic definition of a free market. Other ideas were similar to a professional model
            where salary caps are negotiated through a process of collective bargaining. A key
            finding from this study is that there are differences in stakeholder perceptions of
            how a free market model would potentially impact the development of the NCAA and stakeholders.
            Many of the perceptions identified amongst all or most of the stakeholders interviewed
            are uncommon in the media narratives about the future of the NCAA. Future implications
            of the findings on stakeholder theory were discussed.

            This dissertation presents a multi-criteria decision support system to assist students
            in making this choice. The system employs a hybrid method that first utilizes a fuzzy
            analytic hierarchy process to extract the relative importance of the identified criteria
            and sub-criteria to consider when selecting a supervisor. Then, it applies an information
            retrieval-based similarity algorithm (TF/IDF or Okapi BM25) to retrieve relevant candidate
            supervisor profiles based on the student's research interest. The selected profiles
            are then re-ranked based on other relevant factors chosen by the user, such as publication
            record, research grant record, and collaboration record. The ranking method evaluates
            the potential supervisors objectively based on various metrics that are defined in
            terms of detailed domain-specific knowledge, automating part of the decision making
            process. In contrast with other existing works, this system does not require the professor's
            involvement and no subjective measures are employed.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Understanding the experiences of Chicanas in doctoral study remains salient because
            of pervasive doctoral program attrition rates and severe underrepresentation in the
            professoriate. Chicanas doctoral students engage in these unfamiliar and isolating
            academic environments with few Chicana faculty or peer mentors to help socialize us.
            Without such mentors, it is difficult for Chicana doctoral students to develop a scholarly
            identity. The purpose of this study is to better understand the scholarly identification
            processes among Chicana doctoral students aspiring to the professoriate. This study
            adds activism to the scholarly identification process, aiming to understand how Chicana
            doctoral students become scholar-activists and the ways in which they embody a scholar-activist
            identity on social media.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder that affects various aspects of speech production,
            such as breath support, speech rate, articulation, and prosody. Traditional speech
            therapy involved behavioral changes to how a person with dysarthria speaks. Emerging
            evidence shows familiarization may be a viable alternative option for treatment. Familiarization
            targets the listener’s perceived intelligibility of speech produced by a speaker with
            dysarthria through training with speakers with dysarthria. Recent evidence showed
            familiarization effects generalize between test and training speakers with dysarthria
            who were the same sex, especially if the speech of the two speakers was perceptually
            similar. The current study investigates whether generalization occurs between speakers
            of different sex and the effect perceptual similarity has on this generalization.
            Listeners were recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and were presented with speech
            samples from a speaker with dysarthria. Listeners were assigned to one of two training
            conditions and completed a pre-test and post-test transcription task to measure level
            of intelligibility. Data collected was compared to and analyzed with historical data
            from Borrie et al. (2017a). Results showed a significant effect for level of similarity,
            indicating the listeners trained with a perceptually similar speaker to the test speaker
            showed greater improvements in intelligibility compared to listeners trained with
            a dissimilar speaker, regardless of the speaker’s sex. The listeners in the dissimilar
            training speaker conditions had variable intelligibility improvement scores following
            training. Results indicate familiarization effects generalize between speakers of
            different sex and that improvement is enhanced when trained with a perceptually similar
            speaker.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Maintaining the balance of protein synthesis and degradation is essential for efficient
            proteostasis and organismal health. The 26S proteasome is a large, multisubunit proteolytic
            complex that functions as the primary mechanism for regulated protein degradation
            in eukaryotes. Nearly every biological pathway depends on proteasome-mediated catabolism
            to perform cellular functions or ensure the integrity of its components, making the
            maintenance of proteasome quality critical. The elaborate architecture and large size
            of the proteasome necessitates dedicated quality control mechanisms to ensure the
            integrity, abundance, and functionality of the complex. The mechanisms governing proteasome
            quality control have been implicated in numerous disease pathologies, emphasizing
            the importance of gaining insight into these cellular processes, which remain poorly
            understood. Toward this goal, the work set forth in this dissertation aims to elucidate
            the mechanistic underpinnings of proteasome quality control, focusing on the regulation
            of proteasome assembly and destruction. A cooperative network of regulatory mechanisms
            function to rapidly and faithfully assemble dozens of canonical subunits into a highly-organized,
            functional proteasome. Several alternative proteasome species with non-canonical subunit
            arrangements have been identified and are linked to diverse physiological and pathophysiological
            processes. The mechanisms that control canonical versus non-canonical proteasome biogenesis
            remain largely unknown. The first chapter of this dissertation aims to clarify the
            quality control mechanisms governing subunit incorporation during proteasome biogenesis.
            Failure of proteasome quality control can compromise the integrity of the complex
            and result in the accumulation of aberrant species that can disrupt the proteostatic
            balance, necessitating the critical requirement for a clearance pathway that has only
            recently been identified and remains poorly understood. The second chapter of this
            dissertation aims to study the spatial control of the proteasome during autophagic
            clearance and identify new factors mediating proteasome destruction. Together, the
            work presented in this dissertation provides new insight into the mechanisms of proteasome
            quality control and furthers our understanding into how these processes may be compromised
            to contribute to disease pathology.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In recent years, touch screens and digital technologies have permeated all aspects
            of our lives and increasing numbers of children engage with those devices and digital
            media every day. Children age 8 or younger use tablets and digital applications for
            various activities including watching videos, playing digital games or reading e-books.
            The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents should use high-quality
            educational media as well as engage in meaningful parent-child interactions in conjunction
            with tablet device use. In the literature, there is currently limited research that
            investigates parent-child joint activities and talk around touch screen tablets. The
            main goal of the study was to examine mother-child talk as they engaged in three distinct
            digital activities (e-book reading, video watching, and game playing) on a touch screen
            tablet device. It was expected that different types of mother-child talk would be
            observed during each digital activity. Three hypotheses were tested in the study.
            The first hypothesis predicted that there would be a difference in the total number
            utterances generated by mothers and children during three digital activities. The
            second hypothesis predicted that there would be a difference in the total number of
            utterances generated during e-book reading, compared to video watching and game playing.
            The third hypothesis predicted that there would be a positive correlation between
            children’s utterances across three digital activities and the measure of their receptive
            vocabulary. The current study’s research design was a within subjects (repeated measures)
            design where all participating mothers and children were engaged in three different
            digital activities in a different order. The findings of the current study suggest
            that mothers generated more utterances than their children across three digital activities.
            In addition, the type of digital activity caused differences in the total number of
            utterances generated by mothers and children. The findings of the study also demonstrated
            that the measure of children’s receptive vocabulary was not statistically correlated
            with the type or frequency of child utterances observed across the three digital activities.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This study originally proposed a multitreatment (ABACAC) study design. This design
            was altered to an ABAB reversal design when both participants showed an increase in
            correct responding to science comprehension questions when just visual supports were
            introduced (e.g.,concept map and visual cues). Two Kindergarten boys diagnosed with
            autism spectrum disorder (ASD) participated in this study. This study presented the
            visual supports (e.g., concept map and visual cues) via iPad. The findings from this
            study support the findings found in accommodating students with ASD with concept maps,
            visual cues, and the use of technology. In addition, this study adds to the literature
            by helping participants make meaning and understand relationships with visual supports
            that accommodate the weak central coherence theory. Social validity measures collected
            from both the participants and their mothers show this study was socially important,
            socially acceptable, and socially significant.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The genre of Arthurian literature is defined by its presentation of a noble society
            of knights and ladies, most often utilized in literary texts as a kind of medieval
            shorthand for acceptable social behavior, perhaps especially in aristocratic settings.
            Knighthood is configured most often in French-language literature of the “twelfth-century
            renaissance” as an aspirational masculine social identity, an office ordained by God
            for the elite class. When that literature was translated into Middle English in the
            following centuries, however, the different social functions and expectations of literary
            chivalry in England provided a distinct terroir in which it might grow, producing
            narratives with a courtly cast for a decidedly broader audience, an audience perhaps
            far removed from the literal offices of king and knight. Arthur’s knights in Middle
            English literature thus often embody a more generalized ethos, but the imaginary space
            of Arthurian Britain ensures that its specular capacity for social commentary and
            the stimulation of aspirational identity remains intact, even when the practicable
            nobility of Arthur’s court does not necessarily cohere across texts and traditions.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>DNA is replicated in a defined temporal order termed the RT program. Ordered DNA replication
            is conserved in eukaryotes, yet its biological significance remains enigmatic. 3D
            genome organization as assayed by Hi-C has revealed that RT is highly correlated with
            genome architecture at two scales. Developmentally programmed changes in RT occur
            in units that align with sub-megabase chromatin architectural units known as TADs
            and early and late replicating chromatin is segregated into separate A and B sub-nuclear
            compartments respectively. Transcriptionally permissive histone modifications are
            associated with early replication and A nuclear compartmentalization. Conversely,
            transcriptionally repressive histone modifications are associated with late replication
            and B nuclear compartmentalization. However, studies of mechanisms linking RT and
            chromatin architecture with epigenetic chromatin modifications have been difficult
            since mutation of chromatin regulatory proteins have found only small, localized changes
            in the RT program, not global disruption of ordered replication. Indeed, depletion
            of key architectural proteins such as CTCF and cohesin disrupts TAD structure but
            has little effect on compartments or RT. RIF1 is the only protein shown to have a
            conserved role in regulating RT genome wide. To address the role of RT in organizing
            epigenetic chromatin modifications and genome structure we have generated RIF1 knockouts
            via CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in hESCs and the cancer cell line HCT116. While RT
            changes in HCT116 mirrored those seen in previously published human and mouse RIF1
            null cell lines, remarkably, hESC null cells lose almost all detectable temporal replication
            specificity, despite retaining pluripotency, a nearly normal transcriptome, and cell
            cycle progression. In both cell lines, the effect on RT was due to increased stochastic
            cell to cell variation in RT, rather than discrete RT changes as previously thought.
            Hi-C detected significant changes in compartments driven by changes in interactions
            between peaks of specific histone marks that coordinately increase or decrease in
            intensity. Heterochromatic H3K9me3 peaks were globally reduced in intensity, but highly
            enriched in both peak intensity and interaction strength at certain loci that remained
            late replicating. H3K27me3 showed cell line specific changes, becoming enriched or
            excluded from H3K9me3-rich domains in hESCs or HCT116, respectively. H3K27ac peaks
            also showed a global decrease in peak intensity and interactions between peaks were
            significantly weakened. H3K4me3 peak intensity and inter-peak interactions were depleted
            in the A nuclear compartment and enriched in the B nuclear compartment. TAD architecture
            and Rad21 binding was largely unaffected in both cell lines. We conclude that RIF1
            is necessary to maintain the global epigenetic landscape and suggest a model in which
            RT regulates chromatin and compartment identity in human cells.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This novel, whose title is The Fall, attempts to tell a modern day story of the fall
            of man (traditionally found in the Book of Genesis), from a greater, more humane and
            moral state characterized by goodness toward himself and others, to a lesser state
            characterized by selfishness, narrow ambition and the manipulation and oppression
            of those around him. The protagonist’s name is Nullius Nominis (which means “no name”
            in Latin), but at the beginning of the novel, a passage in which he is unexplainably
            falling from a very tall building known as The Capitol, seat of the Republic, he is
            only described as “the falling man” because he has lost his memory. Unaware of what
            has set his current circumstance in motion, he only knows that he is falling. Somewhat
            miraculously, Nullius is saved from death in the fall, and is rescued by a maintenance
            man named Minos, who takes him beneath the Capitol and cares for him. But, eager to
            find out what has happened to himself, Nullius leaves in the middle of the night,
            only to find that there are posters with his picture on it hung inside the Capitol:
            he is wanted for questioning regarding the mysterious death of the Governor. What
            follows is a journey of sorts, from the bowels of the Capitol to the top floor, fraught
            with danger and intrigue, as, in his attempt to acquit himself, Nullius learns of
            his own strange history, as well as that of humanity itself, and how all this fits
            in to the very future of the Republic.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The field of child welfare continues to suffer due to high rates of worker turnover.
            The child welfare workforce plays a crucial role in promoting child well-being and
            preventing abuse and neglect. When workers leave their jobs, sometimes after only
            a few months, at-risk children are negatively impacted. Work-related trauma exposure
            of workers is an understudied area. This study revealed three categories of trauma
            workers experience as a part of their jobs. Analyses examined the relationship between
            type of trauma exposure and personal and work-related outcomes of child welfare workers
            in the state of Florida. This study examined workers’ exposure to trauma from a stress-response
            framework. Conservation of resources theory and identity theory informed the conceptual
            model for this study. This model examined how different typologies of trauma influence
            workers’ mental health and commitment to the field of child welfare. Mental health
            was examined as a potential mediator in the relationship between trauma and commitment
            to the field. A sample of child welfare workers who had been employed in the field
            for 18-months (n=657) responded to items relating to their experiences of client perpetrated
            violence, deaths or injuries on their caseloads, and secondary trauma. They also completed
            scales measuring their current levels of depression, anxiety, PTSD (at 18 months),
            and their overall commitment to the field of child welfare (measured at 2 years post-hire).
            T-tests, ANOVA analyses, and structural equation modeling (consisting of confirmatory
            factor analysis and path analysis) were used to determine the prevalence, severity,
            and effects of trauma exposure on workers. Three typologies of trauma emerged: primary
            trauma, caseload trauma, and secondary trauma. Threat emerged as the most reported
            form of primary trauma in this sample (78.4%), followed by non-physical violence (44.8%),
            and then assault (5.7%). Twenty-six percent (26%) of workers met the criteria for
            moderate to severe secondary trauma symptomatology. Relating to caseload trauma, 7.7%
            (n=49) of workers reported death of a child on their caseload due to maltreatment,
            16.7% (n=106) reported the death of a child due to accident/injury, and 29.4% (n=187)
            reported the severe illness/injury of a child on their caseload. Moderate to severe
            levels of anxiety and PTSD were found in 4.3% and 3.7% of these child welfare workers.
            Depression levels for workers were higher, with 16.6% reporting moderate levels of
            depression. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis indicated that primary trauma
            had a small, but positive relationship with commitment to the field (B=.17, p&lt;.05).
            Caseload trauma predicted workers’ levels of secondary trauma (B=.14, p&lt;.05), and
            secondary trauma had a strong, predictive relationship with worker mental health (B=.77,
            p&lt;.001). Each type of trauma contributed differentially to workers’ personal and organizational
            outcome. These findings contribute important information about the prevalence and
            effects of different types of trauma child welfare workers face as a part of their
            job. Results of this study have implications for administrative practice, training,
            and intervention development in child welfare. Limitations of this study included
            participant attrition, a limited measurement period for mental health, and the use
            of dichotomous variables to measure primary and caseload trauma. Future research should
            focus on exploring these relationships between worker trauma exposure and personal/organization
            outcomes longitudinally and by using qualitative research methods to examine workers’
            experiences in more depth.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Introduction. A growing body of evidence suggests a strong relationship between age-related
            declines in muscle mass, strength, and power with impaired cognitive function. To
            mitigate these effects, current recommendations consist of resistance exercise training
            (RET) with additional protein intake. The benefits of RET and additional protein intake
            are purposed to be attributed to increases in muscle protein synthesis (MPS), insulin-like
            growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and improved sleep. Previous data indicated that immediate
            post-exercise protein consumption optimizes adaptations to RET, while some long-term
            data are equivocal. Moreover, nighttime pre-sleep protein intake may be important
            as overnight MPS can be lower than basal rates, which is problematic in older adults
            who exhibited blunted MPS to protein intake. However, this has not been well examined
            in older adults, except for one recent study with a suboptimal protein dose. The main
            objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of nighttime pre- sleep
            protein intake on functional and cognitive adaptations during 12 weeks of RET in older
            adults in comparison to the traditional recommendation of immediate post-exercise
            protein intake. Our central hypothesis was that nighttime pre-sleep protein intake
            would significantly improve functional, and cognitive adaptations as much as immediate
            post-exercise protein group in comparison to the exercise only group. Methods. Healthy,
            sedentary, older males (N=30) between the ages of 60-75 years were randomly assigned
            to 1 of 3 groups: 1) Protein immediately post-exercise (Post-ex, n=9), 2) Protein
            30 minutes prior to sleep (Pre-sleep, n=11), or 3) No protein supplementation (Ex
            only, n=10). All 3 groups performed the same 12-week RET program, 2x/wk. The dependent
            variables consisted of pre to post changes in body composition (e.g., lean mass, fat
            mass, % body fat), nitrogen balance, free plasma IGF-1, profile of mood states (POMS),
            sleep evaluation (sleep quantity and quality), and cognitive processing speed (digit
            symbol substitution task and pattern comparison). Maximum muscular strength (1-RM),
            muscular power, and quadriceps muscle hypertrophy (via muscle thickness) were assessed
            at pre-, mid-, and post-intervention. Results. Post-ex exhibited a significant reduction
            in % body fat (-6%, p = 0.018), but there was no significant change in Pre-sleep (0%,
            p &gt; 0.999) or Ex only group (–4%, p = 0.077). Post-ex demonstrated accelerated quadriceps
            muscle hypertrophy from pre to mid (+9%, p = 0.003); however, pre to post increases
            were similar between groups. Pre to post 1-RM improvements were not different between
            groups; however, Post-ex (+6%, p = 0.009) and Pre-sleep (+9%, p = 0.003) demonstrated
            significant increases in chest press 1-RM from mid to post, while Ex only did not
            (+4%, p = 0.226). Peak power was significantly enhanced in Pre-sleep (+10%, p = 0.040)
            with a similar increase observed in Post-ex (+13%) but not in Ex only (+2%). All groups
            were not effective for improving cognitive processing speed. Satiety was significantly
            higher in Pre- sleep compared to Ex only at post (+89%, p = 0.019). There were no
            significant changes in POMS or sleep evaluation. Post-ex (+27%, p = 0.022) and Pre-sleep
            (+40%, p &lt; 0.001) displayed significant increases in free plasma IGF-1, while Ex only
            (+18%, p = 0.080) did not. Free IGF-1 levels were inversely related to fat mass and
            % body fat, which demonstrated significant negative (p = 0.002 and 0.046, respectively)
            moderate (r = -0.667) and low (r = - 0.463) correlations, respectively. Conclusions.
            Our findings suggest that during a 12-week RET program, 40 g of additional protein
            intake, but not specifically at post-exercise or pre-sleep time points, augmented
            the rate of upper body strength adaptations, enhanced peak power, and increased morning
            satiety levels in older adults to a greater extent than exercise only. Our findings
            also indicate that post-exercise protein consumption can further enhance resistance
            exercise-induced improvements in body composition, primarily though fat mass loss,
            and accelerate muscle hypertrophy in comparison to pre-sleep and exercise only interventions.
            The reduced fat mass is associated with increased free IGF-1 levels, although the
            mechanism is not clear.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>For-profit institutions are thought to fill the educational gap when traditional nonprofit
            colleges fail to serve the needs of an evolving student population. Over the past
            several decades, the enrollment share of undergraduate students attending for-profit
            institutions in lieu of traditional nonprofit institutions has expanded substantially.
            While this growth has been noted by researchers, comparatively little is known about
            what determinants impact the state enrollment share of students attending for-profit
            institutions. Furthermore, the chronicling of state policy directed at for-profit
            institutions has not been completed in a concise and accessible manner. This study
            uses a panel dataset spanning the years 1997 to 2015 to measure for-profit enrollment
            to determine the effects of select state-level policy variables on the undergraduate
            enrollment share of for-profit institutions. Results of this study showed that state
            policies do impact for-profit enrollment share. After cataloging relevant state policies,
            18 laws across 10 states were found to directly address the for-profit sector. As
            predicted, laws favorable to for-profit institutions (positive laws) were found to
            increase for-profit enrollment share and laws regulating for-profit institutions (negative
            laws) were found to decrease for-profit enrollment share. Educational appropriations
            per student FTE and the existence of a consolidated governing board were also found
            as controllable variables that impact for-profit enrollment share.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation examines the aging woman trope and the idea of the “trauma and aging”
            in theatre and performance. I argue that the pervasiveness of negative imagery associated
            with aging women as well as decline narratives of age contribute to individual as
            well as cultural trauma that necessitates active resistance and creative responses
            to the violence enacted upon the aging. I maintain that trauma and aging is not solely
            an individual phenomenological experience resulting from a singular moment of violence
            or traumatic event, but can be the result of insidious or everyday trauma. I argue
            that identifying negative images helps to identify stereotype threats and decline
            narratives to distinguish them from individualized stories of aging and fuller, more
            expansive narratives/experiences. The project engages literary theory, theatre studies,
            and age studies as well as theories of violence and trauma to examine the aging female
            trope as a popular literary and theatrical trope within Anglo-American media. I analyze
            the dramatic text or script, the text or script in performance, and the relationship
            of the text or performance to its social, political, and cultural context as well
            as how the objects (images of aging women) might offer counter-examples to the decline
            narrative of age. The primary goal of the project is to provide tools with which to
            unpack and analyze other objects regarding ageism and potentially identify ways that
            views of aging women are circulated in society to a similar effect. The analysis follows
            a chronology of representations beginning with Albee’s "Three Tall Women" and continues
            with textual and performance analysis of Paula Vogel’s "The Oldest Profession" and
            Caryl Churchill’s "Escaped Alone." Each chapter in this dissertation presents its
            own research question(s) and case study analysis that advances my argument with regard
            to 1) the so-called experience of “trauma and aging,” 2) how images in theatre and
            performance have supported negative stereotypes of aging, and 3) how counter-examples
            from theatre and performance might broaden the conversation, perception, and awareness
            about the experience of aging, particularly for women. The goal of the project is
            to go beyond simply identifying plays and performances where stereotypes and tropes
            reinforce, as Ann David Basting points out, the “stubbornly persistent” decline narrative
            of age. The project seeks to complicate the discussion about aged figures in theatre
            and performance expand the conversation to offer counter-examples that contribute
            to an archive of aging narratives that offer fuller, more expansive views aging. These
            conversations are crucial to the humanities not only because theatre scholars have
            largely ignored the discussion of aging, but also particularly in this social-cultural
            moment when ageism, particularly against older women, remains a pervasive and dangerous
            human rights violation.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>A true understanding of urbanism means acknowledging the paradoxical relationship
            that exists between established community and constant development. Originally, an
            approach to balancing the growing congestion of overpopulated suburbs, urbanization
            in many regional towns has become more of a trend than a means of necessity. Effects
            such as gentrification are changing the social make-up of communities and re-shaping
            regional design aesthetics. The new aesthetics seen in redeveloped communities are
            rooted in International and Postmodern design styles that are a stark contrast to
            the existing regional vernacular, creating a sense of territorial aesthetic autonomy.
            Preserving the past can only be accomplished through striving to counter the lack
            of place and identity of International and Postmodern styles, with an emphasis on
            modern tradition that is tied to the cultural and geographical context of a region
            (Framton, 2007). This ideology seeks to prevent a nationalist view of architectural
            style while attempting to mediate between the local and global languages of design.
            The focus of this research explores performative approaches to architectural regionalism
            in Tallahassee FL, and the extirpative effects that these practices have on the town’s
            regional identity as it pertains to aesthetic. This study chose Levy Park in Tallahassee
            due to the visible effects of gentrification that are currently ongoing in the area.
            Levy Park is a neighborhood located in mid-town comprised of pre and post WWII houses
            that have a deep intrinsic connection to Florida’s history. Characteristics such as
            urban amenities, artistic individuality, and charming vernacular style make this area
            highly desired, but major changes in development practices have occurred in the past
            ten years which threaten the neighborhoods authenticity. The data collection methods
            for this research will include a layered approach consisting of two phases. Phase
            one consists of a collection of demographic statistics and phase two includes a detailed
            cataloging of recent infill projects, historical and archival data of demolished and
            renovated structures, and local/ municipal city codes and policies that have affected
            the area. The research findings will identify the effects that performative practices
            in design have on determining and maintaining a regional identity in Tallahassee,
            FL. It will also look at the efficacy of current design trends pertaining to urban
            infill in the neighborhood of Levy Park. Further, it will provide smart growth solutions
            that promote a critical understanding of regionalism and celebrate the historic architectural
            styles that aid in maintaining a strong regional identity.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation tests if fetal loss can be applied as an extension of prior literature
            on the weathering hypothesis. To do so, this study extends upon the weathering hypothesis:
            the observation that blacks experience substantially higher levels of stress than
            their white counterparts in the United States, that this gap only increases as individuals
            become older, and that this resulting stress is correlated with negative health outcomes,
            especially chronic disease. This outcome is proposed to be caused by subtle racist
            events and broader institutional racism, resulting in the literal accumulation of
            stress in the body. The outcome of weathering can be measured in physical responses
            of the individual’s body such as cortisol levels and blood pressure (referred to collectively
            as allostatic load). Because negative events lead to these stress responses being
            more common in blacks than whites, resulting in higher allostatic load, there is a
            corresponding increase in the incidence of health problems such as chronic inflammation.
            In prior research, the impact of weathering on maternal and child health has been
            tested for by examining the choice of early childbearing among black mothers. This
            is a time period where the gap in allostatic load measures is smaller across race.
            Prior studies examining the weathering hypothesis have determined that for minority
            women, and minority women only (particularly black women), the risk of maternal mortality,
            premature birth, low birth weight, and infant mortality is smaller when women become
            pregnant in adolescence as opposed to young adulthood. However, in spite of a fetal
            loss gap by race that is similar to the aforementioned maternal and child health outcomes,
            there is a lack of research into if effects associated with the weathering hypothesis
            occur with fetal loss. Two analyses are performed to test this relationship. The first
            analysis consists of a series of multilevel logistic models on approximately seventeen
            thousand pregnancy outcomes in the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult
            Health (Add Health), examining the relative risk of fetal loss based on racial and
            age characteristics of mothers at the time of pregnancy. The second analysis follows
            with a series of logistic regressions examining approximately four million pregnancies
            in the National Vital Statistics Survey (NVSS) for the years 2016 and 2013, also examining
            the influence of the mother’s race, age, and its interaction on fetal loss risks in
            each year. These analyses find that for each sample (including both years of the NVSS),
            black women overall have higher risks of fetal loss than their white counterparts.
            However, for black and Hispanic-black women, the risk of fetal loss was lower in adolescent
            pregnancies than adult pregnancies, consistent with the weathering hypothesis. The
            findings from this dissertation suggest that the effects of weathering on maternal
            and child healthcare outcomes can in fact be extended to the issue of fetal loss,
            thereby suggesting that stress resulting from racism has a broader collection of harms
            than previously recognized.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation is a qualitative study of activism within writing program administration
            though the lens of the term critical pedagogy. The study responds to calls in the
            field of rhetoric, composition, and writing studies to address inequalities and to
            forward social justice ends. This disciplinary desire can be evidenced in chairs’
            addresses at the flagship conference, The Conference on College Composition and Communication,
            in institutional mission statements and in the pedagogy of individual instructors.
            In the past, local efforts to respond to social justice have been classified under
            the term critical pedagogy. While the term critical pedagogy has fallen out of favor,
            I argue that the term still holds utility for conceiving of a contemporary response
            to progressive desires for teaching. The term critical pedagogy, often associated
            with Paulo Freire, a Chilean activist, is commonly associated with designing classroom
            practice. The term evolved into more frequent parlance in the 1960s and 1970s as institutional
            structures changed, and again in the 1990s, as issues of identity and culture were
            more centrally the focus of composition studies. One conception of critical pedagogy
            is that individual teachers can create social change through classroom practice. It
            is difficult to address global or systemic problems solely at the local level, and
            in reconceiving of critical pedagogy for contemporary exigencies, the need to theorize
            activism on a systemic level is salient. This dissertation study accounts for that
            critique of critical pedagogy by theorizing critical pedagogy from institutional and
            systemic angles utilizing a method called Critical Systems Theory (CST). To theorize
            critical pedagogy and activism from both individual and institutional angles simultaneously,
            this dissertation utilizes qualitative methods, chiefly interviews, chosen for their
            ability to reveal relationships between actors within the educational system. Ten
            writing program administrators from “research extensive” universities (Carnegie Classification
            D/RU-E) were interviewed about institutional contexts, activism, critical pedagogy,
            multiculturalism, and the treatment of race and racism within TA training. The research
            utilizes an ecological framework and is done for the purpose of institutional critique.
            Participants were recruited via e-mail and the “snowball” referral method. Interviews
            were conducted over Skype and transcripts of the interviews were coded for patterns.
            Interviewees were offered three levels of participation to allow for confidentiality:
            confidential participant (name and institution withheld); named participant (name
            and institution present); and collaborator (name and institution present with the
            option for collaborators to give feedback on data and results). Within the study,
            the writing program is conceived of as an entity within multiple ecologies and the
            results of this research reflect that by presenting the results in terms of “inner”
            and “outer” spaces. The inner spaces refer to aspects of the data pertaining to classroom
            pedagogy and the internal administration of writing program administration. The outer
            spaces refer to aspects of writing program administration connected to the institutional,
            external stakeholders and the discipline. Opportunities for administrative agency
            within writing programs or “points of leverage” as they are referred to in the dissertations
            included dialogue, the design of both curriculum and assignments and the mentoring
            of teaching assistants within graduate programs. Opportunities for administrative
            agency in outer spaces included outreach, positive collaboration and acting as a representative
            for writing studies outside of department spaces. Additionally, the study describes
            intersectional factors that modified writing program administrator agency including
            identities or philosophies, location, geography, and pre-existing exigencies that
            modified available resources. This data can be used for the purposes of describing
            the dynamic and situated positionality of a writing program administrator. Limitations
            of this study included the limitations of qualitative research related to the small
            sample size and the difficulty of creating findings from narrative data. Future research
            can be done in terms of replicating this study on a larger scale or looking more extensively
            into more detailed and specific aspects of social justice action within writing programs.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The relation between self-regulation and both academic skills and internalizing symptoms
            is well-established. However, open questions remain regarding the nature of this relation
            and about whether similar or different aspects of self-regulation are most strongly
            related to academic skills vs. internalizing symptoms. Similarly, available evidence
            suggests that self-regulation, as measured by self-report (i.e., effortful control;
            EC), moderates the relation between temperament-based risk and internalizing psychopathology,
            but less is known regarding the status of direct, behavioral measures of self-regulation
            (i.e., executive function; EF) as potential moderators of that relation. This study
            tested competing models of EF in a sample of high school students (M age = 16.09 years,
            SD = 1.04 years). The preferred model was a bifactor model including a general EF
            factor (EFg) and specific working memory (WM) and shifting (SH) factors. This model
            was used to examine the relation between EF and skills in reading and math and to
            test specific EF components, as well as EC, as potential moderators of temperament-based
            risk for internalizing symptoms. The WM specific factor was strongly, positively related
            to reading and math, but the EFg and SH factors were not. EC moderated the relation
            between negative affectivity and panic symptoms. The SH-specific EF factor moderated
            temperament-based risk for depression symptoms, but the EFg and WM factors did not,
            nor did EC.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Recent intensification of agriculture in face of the continuously increasing food
            demand has caused many environmental and socioeconomic problems. Excessive use of
            nitrogen (N) fertilizers is prevalent on many farms today. However, a large proportion
            of the N applied to agricultural soil contributes very little to crop production.
            Instead, a considerable amount of N is lost via leaching into groundwater, via runoff
            into surface water, and via nitrous oxide (N2O) emission into the atmosphere. As a
            result, the ecosystem is negatively impacted. Sustainable N management should aim
            at supplying sufficient N for optimum crop growth and development, while keeping losses
            to the environment to a minimum. Towards this goal, it is essential to enhance N retention
            and at the same time mitigate N2O emission in agricultural soil. Being the leader
            of one USDA project, I investigated the effects of different N management approaches
            that are based on the use of biochar, dicyandiamide (nitrification inhibitor) and
            polyacrylamide (superabsorbent hydrogel) in agricultural soils. It was found that
            a significantly higher amount of ammonium (NH4+) could be retained in the biochar-amended
            soil, comparing to the control soil. However, the retention of other ionic forms of
            N, such as nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-), was barely improved. In fertilized soil,
            nitrification is a common process that transforms NH4+ into NO2- and eventually NO3-.
            To limit this transformation, the effects of one of the most commonly used nitrification
            inhibitor, i.e., dicyandiamide (DCD), was studied in combination with biochar. Based
            on the experimental data, mathematical models were developed to estimate the rate
            of nitrification impacted by the inhibition of persistently degrading DCD. It was
            discovered that the presence of biochar accelerated the biodegradation of both DCD
            and NH4+, but effectively reduced the spatial separation between the two. Depending
            on the soil properties and environmental conditions, the combined use of DCD and biochar
            can have versatile effects on nitrification inhibition. Also, considering the great
            amount of field data reported in the literature, statistical methods such as data
            synthesis and meta-analysis were also exploited to excavate the insightful information
            on the effectiveness of different soil amendments (e.g., biochar) in terms of N retention,
            crop production and N2O emission. Lastly, the recalcitrance of biochar, which is directly
            related to biochar’s soil carbon sequestration potential, was also discussed. In order
            to quantify and compare the soil carbon sequestration potential of biochar produced
            from different conditions and feedstock types, a carbon-based recalcitrance index
            was developed using a state-of-the-art thermochemical technique.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The dissertation presents the recent development of the third-generation femtosecond
            electron diffractometer in Professor Jim Cao’s group. Two techniques, femtosecond
            electron shadow imaging and deflectometry (FESID) and femtosecond electron diffraction
            (FED), were developed and applied to study ultrafast dynamics in laser-induced warm
            dense matter and quantum dots in real time. FESID provides both a global view and
            local prospect of the transient electric field, associated with laser-induced electron
            emission. The research activities cover two main objects: dynamics of ejected electron
            expansion from warm dense nanofilms and hyperthermal electron transport mechanisms
            in warm dense nanofilms. With FED, we measure laser-induced ultrafast structural dynamics
            of halide perovskite CsPbBr3 in real time. In the first project, we conduct ultrafast
            electron shadow imaging and deflection measurements of the laser-produced warm dense
            copper nanofilm. The results show that a significant number of electrons is ejected
            from the nanofilm, forming electron clouds of hundreds of microns on both sides of
            the pumped film. Furthermore, even for a thin 30-nm copper film, we find that the
            electron clouds develop asymmetry between the pumped front side and the rear side
            at the pump fluence of 4.5 J/cm2. The possible mechanisms leading to this ejected
            charge asymmetry and its implication are discussed. Next, we report a systematic study
            of the ejected charge dynamics surrounding laser produced 30-nm warm dense gold films
            using single-shot femtosecond electron shadow imaging and deflectometry. The results
            reveal a two-step dynamical process of the ejected electrons under the high pump fluence
            conditions: an initial emission and accumulation of a large number of electrons near
            the pumped surface region followed by the formation of hemispherical clouds of electrons
            on both sides of the film, which escape into the vacuum at a nearly isotropic and
            constant velocity with an unusually high kinetic energy of more than 300 eV. We also
            develop a model of the escaping charge distribution that not only reproduces the main
            features of the observed charge expansion dynamics but also allows us to extract the
            number of ejected electrons remaining in the cloud. In the second project, we investigate
            hyperthermal electron transport by single-shot measurements of warm dense gold and
            aluminum nanofilms using ultrafast electron shadow imaging and deflectometry. The
            results show a clear fluence limit of 0.26 J/cm2 and 0.83 J/cm2 for ballistic transport
            of nonthermal electrons for both two metals, respectively. This nonuniform heating
            is attributed to diffusive electrons. The last project, we have measured the ultrafast
            structural dynamics in halide perovskite CsPbBr3 in real time with Femtosecond electron
            diffraction. We observed CsPbBr3 experience significant ultrafast impulsive heating.
            This heating causes the CsPbBr3 to undergo an orthorhombic-to-cubic phase transition
            observable through FED. The photo induced phase transition occurs on the timescale
            of 1.1 ± 0.3 ps at fluences of 2.5 mJ/cm2.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation contributes to the public policy literature by examining subnational
            political competition, policy change and performance in the context of U.S. and China.
            In a three paper format, this dissertation investigates different dimensions: Policy,
            patronage measurement, and performance. The first paper examines what factors cause
            states to experience both incremental and large-scale policy changes. This study argues
            that electoral incentives might influence the search, supply and processing of information
            on constituency issues, as well as the associated cognitive or institutional frictions,
            and thus determine the presence and variation of punctuated policies. This article
            develops and evaluates this claim within a systemic framework consisting of policy
            transparency, political institutions, and electoral incentives by analyzing the budget
            spending data collected from FY 1988 to FY 2008 for all 50 American states. The second
            paper constructs a new index to measure patronage appointment on city managers in
            China. The third paper investigates how the interactions of patronage appointment
            with political competition facing public managers in the local governments shape government
            performance by looking at 1,085 city mayors across 279 Chinese cities from 2002 to
            2012.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This thesis elaborates and tests a model of nonprofit leadership development. Nonprofit
            leaders create meaning for other nonprofit participants through their activities and
            words and thus need to possess skills for interpreting the ongoing actions, interests,
            and values of various stakeholders. Because of the importance of these meaning-making
            activities, this study advances a model of interpretive leadership skill as an essential
            nonprofit leader competency with three distinctive dimensions. Interpretive leadership
            skill is defined as the individual leader’s ability to discover, reflect on, and coordinate
            the organization’s ongoing construction of reality. I also illustrate how leadership
            skills are articulated through three levels of development that correspond to cognitive
            capacity, identity formation, and leader competency. This research suggests that interpretive
            leadership skill arises from the nonprofit leader’s ongoing cognitive processes of
            developmental sensemaking, which are mediated through forming one’s identity as a
            leader, developing values, and engaging in leadership practice. Constructive-developmental
            theory of leadership (Day et al., 2009; McCauley et al., 2006; Mumford et al., 2000)
            underlies the model development. This template illuminates the importance and evolving
            nature of meaning-making leadership in nonprofits. This model is examined through
            multiple analytical procedures: scale development and validation of interpretive leadership
            skill and structural equation modeling analysis of the leadership development model.
            Data are drawn from a national survey of nonprofit executive directors administered
            by the researcher. Findings of this research support the theory building as well as
            suggest noteworthy implications for nonprofit-sector leadership.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Decision-making (DM) is a critical task performed by military medics. Often split-second
            decisions must be made and executed in high pressure situations that tax the human
            system. The consequence for either making the wrong decision or executing the right
            decision poorly can threaten medics’ survival and the survival of those they are treating.
            While experience and a solid knowledge base are necessary components in the DM process,
            these qualities may not be sufficient. DM is strongly influenced by the medics’ schemas,
            and emotions and attention activate these blueprints (Tenenbaum &amp; Razon, 2008). Because
            DM is greatly influenced by the aforementioned factors, we conducted a case study
            using three experienced United States (US) Army medics to enhance our understanding
            of the impacts of a 12-session intervention designed to enhance Tactical Combat Casualty
            Care (TC3) DM under pressure. The training program began with arousal control (AC)
            as the medic’s Internal Environment (i.e., emotion-memory relationship) affects the
            perception-cognition-action linkage, and thus each aspect of the DM process (Tenenbaum
            et al., 2009). Because perception and cognition are inter-related and play a critical
            role in DM (Tenenbaum &amp; Razon, 2008), the intervention also included imagery-driven
            schema development (SD) and attention training (AT). Multiple sources of data, including
            both qualitative and quantitative measures were incorporated into the near and far
            transfer measures to provide an in-depth examination of the effectiveness of the DM
            training. Near transfer measures, which were assessed at four points, included baseline
            biometrics (e.g., HRV), imagery use, and a computer-based multi-tasking and an attention
            shifting task. As hypothesized, all near transfer measures increased for each medic.
            Far transfer measures consisted of TC3 performance ratings and interviews, resting
            biometrics taken pre- and post-performance, active biometrics collected during TC3
            execution, appraisal-based surveys, and interviews pertaining to TC3 anticipation
            and attention. TC3 performance improved for two of the three medics. As expected,
            average resting and active HRV increased for each medic. This study supported the
            previously found relationship between perceived stress reactivity and higher threat
            appraisals, negative emotions and reduced performance satisfaction (Britton et al.,
            2019; Nicholls et al., 2012). Overall imagery use increased and may have exerted some
            influence on performance. Lastly, we found TC3 performance and evaluator-derived relevant
            attention frequency to be associated. Although the medics may have reduced their self-reported
            relevant attention, their ability to refocus upon recognition of distraction improved.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In this thesis, the excited states $^{33}$P were populated by the $^{18}$O+$^{18}$O
            reaction at E$_{lab}$=24 MeV. The GAMMASPEHRE array was used along with the Microball
            particle detector array to detect $\gamma$ transitions in coincidence with the charged
            particles emitted from the compound nucleus $^{36}$S. The use of Microball enabled
            the selection of the proton emission channel. It also helped in determining the position
            and energy of the emitted proton; which eventually helped in calculating more precise
            direction of the recoils to achieve better Doppler corrections. 16 new transitions
            and 13 new states were observed in $^{33}$P for the first time. The nearly 4$\pi$
            geometry of GAMMASPEHRE allowed the measurement of $\gamma$-ray angular distributions
            leading to spin suggestions for many states. \\ In a separate experiment conducted
            at the John D. Fox laboratory in Florida State University, the higher-spin structure
            of $^{38}$Cl ($N = 21$) was investigated following the $^{26}$Mg($^{14}$C, $pn$) reaction
            at 30 and 37 MeV. The outgoing protons were detected in an $E- \Delta E$ Si telescope
            placed at 0$^\circ$ close to the target with a Ta beam stopper between the target
            and telescope. Multiple $\gamma$ rays were detected in time coincidence with the protons
            using an enhanced version of the FSU $\gamma$ detection array. A total of 11 new $\gamma$
            transitions and 6 new states were reported for the first time. DCO ratio analysis
            and measurement of polarization asymmetry for the emitted $\gamma$ transitions were
            performed to assign spins and parities to a number of states. The level scheme was
            extended up to 8420 keV with a likely spin of 10 $\hbar$. \\ A new empirical shell
            model interaction was developed in the $spsdfp$ model space. This FSU interaction
            was built by fitting to the energies of 270 experimental states from $^{13}$C to $^{51}$Ti.
            Calculations using the FSU interaction reproduced observed energy states of $^{33}$P
            and $^{38}$Cl rather well, including other spectroscopic properties. The interaction
            has been used to predict the intruder states of other $sd$-shell nuclei, along with
            the configurations of the nuclei belong to the Island of Inversion region of the nuclear
            landscape.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Large volumes of genomic data and new scientific discoveries in biomedical research
            are being made every day by laboratories in both academia and industry. However, two
            issues severely affect the usability of so-called biomedical big data: 1) the majority
            of the public genomic data do not contain enough clinical information, and 2) scientific
            discoveries are stored in text as unstructured data. This dissertation presents two
            studies, which address each issue using machine learning methods, in order to maximize
            the usability of biomedical big data. In the first study, we infer missing clinical
            information using multiple gene expression data sets and a wide variety of machine
            learning methods. We proposed a new performance measure, Proportion of Positives which
            can be predicted with High accuracy (PPH), to evaluate models in term of their effectiveness
            in recovering data with missing clinical information. PPH estimates the percentage
            of data that can be recovered given a desired level of accuracy. The experiment results
            demonstrate the effectiveness of the predicted clinical information in downstream
            inference tasks. In the second study, we propose a three-stage computational method
            to automatically extract chemical-protein interactions (CPIs) from a given text. Our
            method extracts CPI-pairs and CPI-triplets from sentences; where a CPI-pair consists
            of a chemical compound and a protein name, and a CPI-triplet consists of a CPI-pair
            along with an interaction word describing their relationship. We extract a diverse
            set of features from sentences, which are used to build multiple machine learning
            models. Our models contain both simple features, which can be directly computed from
            sentences, and more sophisticated features derived using sentence structure analysis
            techniques. Our method performed the best among systems which use non-deep-learning
            methods, and outperformed several deep-learning-based systems in the track 5 of the
            BioCreative VI challenge. The features we designed in this study are informative and
            can be applied to other machine learning methods including deep learning.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Seagrasses are valued for the range of ecosystem services they provide such as nursery
            and adult habitat for commercially and recreationally fished species, a critical food
            resource for threatened species, and filtration systems for improving water quality.
            In Florida, seagrasses are estimated to contribute $20 billion annually in benefits
            to the Florida Gulf Coast (FGC) region. However, even with the numerous benefits that
            seagrasses have been shown to provide they are still at risk due to anthropogenic
            pressures. Given the established importance of and threats to seagrasses, seagrass
            mapping and monitoring programs in the FGC have worked to better understand and predict
            the patterns of seagrass decline. Traditional methods for monitoring or mapping seagrasses,
            such as intensive field surveys (scuba/snorkeling) or costly aerial surveys often
            result in inconsistencies in the data necessary to better understand the spatial and
            temporal dynamics of seagrasses. This project used Landsat 5 satellite imagery to
            classify seagrasses in the Big Bend region of the FGC using a random forest model.
            Four years of data over a 15 year timeframe were classified and accuracies between
            78-88% were achieved for the seagrass class. Counter to the prevailing narrative of
            seagrass degradation throughout the Gulf coast, 291 km2 of seagrass were gained between
            1996-2011, with only 116 km2 lost in this same time period. Both seagrass losses and
            gains were positively spatially autocorrelated. Results from this project indicate
            that both accurate classifications and spatiotemporal analyses can be conducted using
            remotely sensed data for areas with limited or inconsistent field survey data.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Embodied cognition, which stresses the intertwined nature of the perceptual-motor
            system and cognitive processes (Willems &amp; Francken, 2012), has been a prominent area
            of focus in replication failures and the broader discussion of the validity of an
            embodied theory of cognition. What follows is an attempt to assess the effectiveness
            of one of the early behavioral measures (the Action-sentence Compatibility Effect,
            Glenberg &amp; Kaschak, 2002), which served as an existence proof for embodied cognition.
            The original task was replicated, and extended, in order to address underlying cognitive
            mechanisms that may play a more central role to the theory than previously thought.
            The role of memory and attention were directly manipulated in order to assess their
            impact on the magnitude of the ACE measurement. The results are discussed, giving
            context and insight to the task specifically, as well as what these results mean to
            the embodied cognition theory overall.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Relationship conflict is a stressful experience for couples and stress can disrupt
            the balance within the immune system. In particular, stressful experiences tend to
            be linked with an upregulation of cytokines. In this study, I examined whether being
            the target of oppositional behavior from one’s partner during a conflict interaction—a
            factor that is linked with greater stress during conflict—would be associated with
            upregulation of the cytokine interleukin-1β. Data were drawn from a sample of newlywed
            couples; interleukin-1β was assayed from saliva samples collected before and after
            four conflict interactions. This study extends the literature in three meaningful
            ways: (1) analyses differentiated between third-party observers’ assessments of partner
            oppositional behavior and individuals’ perceptions of partner oppositional behavior,
            (2) effects of the discrete conflict observed in the lab were isolated by accounting
            for critical covariates that indicate greater relationship conflict more generally,
            and (3) moderation analyses tested whether individual differences associated with
            greater sensitivity to conflict exacerbated the association between partner oppositional
            behavior and post-conflict interleukin-1β. Overall, the results largely did not support
            my hypotheses. However, an effect in the opposite direction to my predictions emerged:
            individuals with high self-esteem, compared to those with low self-esteem, experienced
            greater cytokine upregulation when they perceived partner opposition. There was also
            a trend for men to experience greater upregulation than women when perceiving partner
            opposition. Findings are discussed in light of differences in cytokine measurement
            between the current study which assessed interleukin-1β in saliva and past research
            which focused on assessments of other cytokines in plasma. Overall, findings highlight
            the importance of examining perceptions and individual difference variables when examining
            links between relationship conflict and health.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The goal of this dissertation is to describe a series of developments and applications
            of the variational two-electron reduced density matrix (v2RDM-) complete active space
            self-consistent field (CASSCF) method to the electron correlation problem in electronic
            structure theory. The v2RDM-CASSCF method is a complete active space (CAS) method
            based on optimizing the two-electron reduced density matrix (2RDM). Since the 2RDM
            is a more compact object than the $N$-electron wavefunction, it is possible to formulate
            a CAS approach that scales polynomially, rather than exponentially, with respect to
            the size of the active space. For this reason, computer implementations of v2RDM-driven
            CASSCF are capable of treating active spaces much larger than the limit of current
            implementations of wavefunction-/configuration interaction (CI-) driven wavefunction
            CASSCF. The work described in this dissertation addresses three deficiencies of v2RDM-CASSCF:
            the lack of an analytic energy derivative code, the lack of an efficient code with
            which to compute excited states, and the lack of a method with which to correct the
            v2RDM-CASSCF energy for dynamical correlation. We develop analytic first derivatives
            of the v2RDM-CASSCF energy, and we show, in fact, that the expressions for the analytic
            first derivative of the energy are identical to those for CI-based CASSCF. For the
            excited state problem, we improve an approach by which excited states and excited
            state properties can be computed from the ground state 2RDM. Lastly, we develop a
            model for dynamical correlation for v2RDM-CASSCF references. With this model, energies
            computed at the v2RDM-CASSCF level of theory can be corrected to account for the effects
            of dynamical correlation.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) or exosomes are responsible for a variety of signaling
            processes and overall physiological and pathological states of stem cells and tissues.
            Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have unique characteristics that can
            mimic embryonic tissue development. EVs derived from hiPSCs can be used as therapeutics,
            biomarkers, and drug delivery vehicles. One issue is that little is known about the
            characteristics of secreted EVs/exosomes by hiPSCs during tissue morphogenesis due
            to paracrine signaling. In this study, EVs derived from hiPSC-derived neural progenitors
            (ectoderm), hiPSC-derived cardiac cells (mesoderm), and the undifferentiated hiPSCs
            (healthy iPSK3 and Alzheimer’s associated SY-UBH lines) were analyzed. Nanoparticle
            tracking analysis and electron microscopy results showed that the derived EVs had
            the average size of 100-250 nm. Western blot revealed that exosomal markers ALIX,
            CD63, and TSG 101 were expressed in the derived EVs. miRNAs including miR-133 and
            miR-155 were differently expressed in different EV groups. Treating the cortical spheroids
            with different EVs in vitro showed the differential abilities of increasing cell proliferation
            (indicated by BrdU assay) and axonal growth (indicated by β-tubulin III staining).
            For the Aβ42 oligomer treated cultures, the derived EVs increased cell viability and
            reduced oxidative stress differentially, showing neural protective ability. This study
            should advance our understanding of cell-cell communications in stem cell microenvironment
            and provide possible therapeutic options for treating neural degeneration.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation explores the impact and influence of undergraduate major programs
            in writing and rhetoric on the lives of their students through an alumni study of
            the Editing, Writing, and Media (EWM) major at Florida State University. Building
            on prior alumni studies in the field of Rhetoric and Composition, this study captures
            a capacious portrait of alumni lives prior to, during, and after their time within
            the EWM program. Framing this portrait is Kathleen Blakey Yancey’s three-part curricular
            framework of the delivered curriculum (the institutional materials that instantiate
            a course of study), lived curriculum (students’ prior knowledge and experience they
            draw upon in a course or program) , and experienced curriculum (a student’s unique
            set of experiences in a major program). In order to account for alumni lives following
            graduation, this project theorizes a fourth curriculum known as the remembered, comprised
            of the elements of a student’s experienced curriculum that influence their subsequent
            lives of alumni. Three questions guide this study: 1) How do alumni retrospectively
            perceive their experience and knowledge prior to enrolling in a major program as influencing
            their experiences in an undergraduate writing major? 2) What elements of an undergraduate
            major curriculum do alumni perceive and report as contributors to their lives after
            graduation? 3) How do alumni of this undergraduate writing major perceive and report
            the influence of their experiences in an undergraduate writing major on their lives
            after graduation? To address these research questions, the study relies on an alumni
            survey and three interview case studies, with each case study containing two mapping
            activities. The survey collects demographic information from EWM alumni, alongside
            their reasons for enrolling in the major (lived curriculum), their perceptions of
            their learning within the EWM program (experienced curriculum), their academic and
            professional experiences following graduation, current writing tasks, perceptions
            of how the EWM program has influenced those experiences, and perceptions of how well
            the EWM program prepared them to meet the program’s outcomes (remembered curriculum).
            The interview protocol asks alumni to create two maps of their a) experiences at Florida
            State University and b) current writing tasks, and document their perceived connections
            among the elements within each map; after alumni the complete those maps, I ask them
            semistructured interview questions about their perceived relationships between and
            among their lived and experienced curricula and how they influence the remembered
            curricula in their current lives. The data generated by the survey and case studies
            provide insight into the lived, experienced, and remembered curricula of EWM alumni.
            The lived curriculum is most prominently defined by two factors: first, alumni’s prior
            writing experiences, and second, their aspirations to pursue careers related to writing.
            Alumni cite structured writing environments like courses and/or co-curricular activities
            and self-sponsored writing tasks like fiction and/or blogging as both leading them
            to enroll in the program and shaping their course projects. Further, a large portion
            of alumni believe the EWM program would prepare them to write within professional
            environments including but not limited to the publishing industry. The experienced
            curriculum shows that alumni benefit from the gateway courses of Writing and Editing
            in Print and Online (WEPO) and Rhetoric and their required internship, as these experiences
            prepare them to compose rhetorical texts for a variety of contexts and within multiple
            genres. However, alumni feel they were less prepared to engage with the visual dimensions
            of composing and work within advanced composing technologies. Additionally, alumni
            consistently rely on a sense of pragmatism to identify elements of the EWM program
            that they retrospectively value, frequently benefitting from experiences they are
            able to adapt into their own writing. The remembered curriculum shows that the EWM
            program prepares alumni to enter into a range of academic and professional opportunities,
            with 40% entering postgraduate study and 93.7% finding employment following graduation;
            alumni consistently feel the EWM program positively influences these experiences.
            Personal and professional writing are the most frequent types of writing alumni complete,
            with 78% completing some form of self-sponsored writing and 70% writing more than
            ten hours a week for their occupations. In describing their current writing processes,
            alumni exhibit varying degrees of rhetorical awareness, with their explanations tethered
            to concepts such as context, audience, and genre guiding their rhetorical decision-making
            processes. Together, these results illustrate the influence of alumni’s prior writing
            on their rhetorical education within undergraduate majors, emphasize the importance
            of praxis for alums’ experienced curricula, and exhibit the varying ways in which
            undergraduate major programs can influence the writing lives of its alumni.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Music therapy is a rapidly growing allied health profession. In order to become a
            board-certified music therapist (MT-BC), one must complete a college degree program
            approved by the American Music Therapy Association, which includes an AMTA approved
            program of study and a six-month internship under the supervision of an MT-BC in good
            standing with the Certification Board of Music Therapy. This study focused on the
            six-month internship aspect of training. A content analysis was conducted to determine
            what information is available on the web to aid prospective music therapy interns
            in deciding where they will apply, and to aid internship sites to receive applicants
            who are likely to fit well with the existing program. A web search was conducted using
            the National Roster Internship link found on the “Education and Careers” tab of the
            American Music Therapy Association website, which yielded 64 results (N=64). Of the
            sample (N=64), 52 sites were active and 12 were inactive, 31 had a website/tab/link,
            and 33 did not. Additionally, five internship sites had a Facebook page. Twenty-nine
            (45.3%) of the National Roster Internship sites did not have information available
            on the web to be assessed, meaning (n=35) internship sites remained for consideration
            in data collection. A total of 15 categories of information were assessed for all
            websites included in the analysis, and “music therapy” was the only category investigated
            listed consistently across 100% of all websites. The lack of consistent information
            may inhibit accurate internship comparisons for students as they seek information
            about internship placements.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Unlike mathematical ability, mathematical language consists of terminology that is
            necessary to understand and participate in mathematical tasks. More recently, research
            indicates that mathematical language is vital for mathematic performance. Research
            examining mathematical language may help us better understand the long-established
            relation between mathematical performance and literacy. Further, little is known about
            potential correlations of mathematical language. Here, I will examine the relation
            between mathematical language with socioeconomic status (SES) and math anxiety. I
            find that both mathematical language and reading ability predict mathematics performance,
            but reading ability is the stronger predictor. Finally, both socioeconomic status
            and math anxiety are significant predictors of mathematical language.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The present study compared a sample of first-year university students residing in
            Living Learning Programs (LLPs; n = 64) with a matched-group of first-year students
            residing in traditional residence halls (n = 83) at a large university located in
            the southeastern United States. The study examined if students in LLPs experience
            greater belongingness, perceived social support, and mental health in comparison to
            peers in traditional residence halls, and if this corresponds to greater help-seeking
            intentions and superior RA mental health gatekeeper performance. Participants completed
            the Psychological Sense of School Membership Scale (PSSM; Goodenow, 1993), the Multidimensional
            Scale of Perceived Social Support (Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, &amp; Farley, 1988), the Mental
            Health Continuum Short-Form (Keyes, 2009a), and an RA Gatekeeper Performance and Student
            Help-Seeking Questionnaire that was designed by the researcher. Findings from the
            present study suggest that LLPs are effective for increasing the amount of social
            support and belongingness students’ experience in relation to their resident hall
            communities, but not for increasing overall or global belongingness and social support.
            Results also indicate that students in LLPs received more support from their RA mental
            health gatekeeper and exhibited greater help-seeking intentions towards RAs and resident
            hall peers in comparison to students in traditional residence halls. A discussion
            of the findings is offered in support of Wyman and colleagues’ (2008) communication
            model of gatekeeper training. Implications for theory, research, and practice are
            discussed, in addition to suggestions for future research. Keywords: living learning

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Archaeologists have been interested in the foodways of prehistoric peoples for over
            half a century, leading to a plethora of analyses on diet and subsistence strategies.
            In the last 30 years, archaeologists have come to focus on the role of food in ideological,
            political, and social settings. One avenue of exploration into these relationships
            is through the identification of communal eating events, or feasting. In this thesis
            I investigate whether or not feasting events occurred at Grand Mound Shell Ring (8Du1),
            Duval County, Florida. To test this, I compare the faunal assemblage from three discrete
            deposits (nineteen units and six features) at Grand Mound Shell Ring to archaeological
            correlates of feasting outlined by three different models (Jackson and Scott 1995;
            Twiss 2008; VanDerwarker 1999; VanDerwarker et al. 2007). My analysis, based on the
            faunal material and limited contextual information, found it is likely that communal
            feasting activities took place at Grand Mound Shell Ring.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Departmentalization is a growing trend in elementary schools nationwide due to a focus
            on high stakes accountability testing. In a departmentalized school, teachers specialize
            in one to three subject areas and students benefit from the instruction of teachers
            with expert knowledge in their specific areas as opposed to the traditional, self-contained
            elementary school model where students receive instruction in multiple subjects from
            one teacher. This mixed methods study sought to investigate the process of departmentalizing
            fourth and fifth grade classrooms, and to examine the relationship between departmentalization
            and student achievement growth in St. Lucie Public Schools in Florida. The study found
            that elementary and K-8 schools with higher poverty populations, as well as schools
            with lower student enrollments, were the most likely to utilize departmentalization,
            especially a semi-departmentalized model in the fourth grade level. Students in departmentalized
            classrooms showed less growth over the course of the school year. The choice to departmentalize
            was largely teacher-directed and assignment of specific subjects to teachers was based
            on teachers’ strength, comfort levels, and supporting student data. These findings
            are discussed and recommendations for the district are offered in the final chapter.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The current study examined the impact of taking a career development course on career
            decision making. Specifically, this study sought to determine when students are likely
            to see the greatest changes in career decision state, as well as how students’ negative
            career thinking can impact such changes. The sample consisted of 151 undergraduate
            students participating in a career course that was theoretically informed by cognitive
            information processing (CIP; Sampson, Reardon, Peterson, &amp; Lenz, 2004). The Career
            State Inventory (CSI; Leierer, Peterson, Reardon, &amp; Osborn, 2017) was used to measure
            students’ career decision state throughout each unit of the course, while the Career
            Thoughts Inventory (CTI; Sampson et al., 1996a) was used as a measure of negative
            career thinking. A repeated-measures ANOVA was performed to determine differences
            in course impact by level of negative career thinking (high, medium, low). Results
            of the ANOVA analysis found that students reported significantly more positive career
            decision states following Unit I and Unit III of the course, but not Unit II of the
            course. Additionally, results from that same analysis found an interaction effect
            between the course and negative career thinking; indicating that students with higher
            levels of negative career thinking started and maintained less positive career decisions
            states throughout the course, compared to those of medium and lower levels of negative
            career thinking. Finally, a second repeated-measures ANOVA found that students who
            saw the greatest decrease in negative career thinking throughout the course also saw
            the greatest changes towards a more positive career decision state. A discussion of
            the findings is offered, followed by the study’s limitations, and the implications
            for theory, research, practice, and policy.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>"Flowers as Mind Control" is a debut collection of poems that mixes the Welsh notion
            of Hiraeth and memories with a fiery, insatiable need to "power through." It also
            blends narrative elements with lyric ones. Here I try for a raw edge that's an outlaw
            perspective beyond many first collections, but the selvage is also softened by empathy
            in the face of humanity's tryst with failure and trauma. Collectively, the poems in
            this dissertation articulate the social anxieties of entering the middle of one's
            life, accepting them, but specifically as a woman who values truth and beauty as parallel
            to the complicated nexus of romantic and feminist in a world that rarely values the
            "duende" in any of them. From this perspective, the speaker weaves humor, grief, loss,
            and gratitude as witnesses along the way, ending in a supplication of endurance. Drawing
            inspirational structure from the slim volumes of Pablo Neruda's Twenty Love Poems
            &amp; A Song of Despair or Deborah Digges' Vesper Sparrows, this collection, once voluminous
            and sprawling, is now a concise book of lyrical prayers to survival. These poems explore
            new ground in how they make fun of, or subvert the idea of the person being held back
            or propelled through nature which is often atavistic, corrosive, or unfiltered in
            its foggy contempt for the artist. This collection proves powerful ownership in the
            face of uncertainty and a respectful certainty in one's own ability to heal and change.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Though many scholars have already remarked upon the Caribbean as a site of cultural
            and culinary convergence, this study specifically addresses the role of women, desire,
            and food within literature of the region. Existing research on these topics tends
            to focus on the phenomenology of events within Caribbean history. Scholars have noted
            the function of food in nation-building, the impact of plantation economics across
            the islands, and the symbolic power of edible commodities in the region, but few employ
            a gendered lens to examine the intersections of these areas. My research illustrates
            how postcolonial female subjects are inextricable from edible commodities cultivated
            in the Caribbean and how women writers such as Edwidge Danticat, Shani Mootoo, and
            Pauline Melville have made use of this property in contemporary literature as a means
            of reclaiming history and shaping identity. This project will analyze novels and short
            stories with feminist postcolonial theory and historiographic research as a framework.
            My dissertation is informed by notions of “eating the Other” as articulated by bell
            hooks as well as Valérie Loichot's The Tropics Bite Back: Culinary Coups in Caribbean
            Literature. Additionally, Racial Indigestion: Eating Bodies in the nineteenth Century
            by Kyla Wazana Tompkins shapes my understanding of gender and edibility. I situate
            my research within the larger field of critical eating studies as defined by Tompkins.
            The function of critical eating studies is to show the politicized nature of eating
            as well as the overlap between the fetishization of food objects, racial minorities,
            and women. My dissertation project is unique in its focus on the specific contributions
            of living Caribbean women authors. While my work draws from history and cultural studies,
            it remains rooted in literary scholarship. I understand literature as the space where
            lost narratives can be excavated, resurfaced, and re-presented to ultimately enrich
            our understanding of writing and history. The structure of my inquiry is built upon
            three intersections of women, desire, and food. First, the enslaved female body has
            been a site of colonial rule and exploitation. In history and literature, brown and
            black women are often likened to sugar, coffee and cacao – all edible commodities
            that periodically served as the impetus for the colonization of the islands of the
            Caribbean and the nation states that subsequently formed. I show the impact of this
            association on Caribbean labor and national identity construction in the second chapter.
            Namely, I unpack the paradox of domestic laborers in that many Caribbean women must
            work in the service of families and bodies that are not their own. The next chapter
            highlights the role of bricolage in making sense of trauma and fractured identity.
            In my fourth chapter, I show the impact of tourism on women using Here Comes the Sun
            by Nicole Dennis-Benn. In the final chapter, I inspect how prescribed gender roles
            are subverted by Caribbean women and how sensation and spectacle work as means of
            empowerment and self-actualization.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The dual-pathway model (Sonuga-Barke, 2002, 2003) proposes Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
            Disorder (ADHD) develops along two distinct but interrelated developmental pathways,
            a cognitive pathway of inhibitory control (IC) deficits and a delay-aversion pathway
            (i.e., hypersensitivity to delay). Studies suggest delay-of-gratification (DG) tasks
            tap both components of the dual-pathway model, and, therefore, it is unclear whether
            IC, DG, and delay-aversion tasks are measuring distinct constructs. The purpose of
            this study was to investigate the dimensionality of the constructs underlying the
            dual-pathway model and their differential impacts on ADHD symptomology and early academic
            skills in preschool-age children. Results of confirmatory factor analyses of data
            from 163 preschool children (49% female; mean age 55.42 months, SD = 8.42) indicated
            that measures of IC, DG, and delay-aversion were best conceptualized as two factors,
            rather than three distinct constructs. Specifically, IC and DG tasks were best represented
            as a single factor, and Delay-Aversion was a distinct factor. Although the IC + DG
            factor was significantly related to both teacher report of ADHD symptoms and early
            academic skills, the Delay-Aversion factor was not. In contrast to predictions based
            on the dual-pathway model, ADHD symptoms did not mediate the relation between the
            IC + DG factor and early academic skills. Overall, although results of this study
            indicate that delay-aversion tasks sufficiently reduce the influence of IC, the lack
            of association between delay-aversion and both ADHD symptomology and early academic
            skills makes it unclear what delay-aversion tasks are measuring. Taken together, this
            study highlights possible limitations in the applicability of the dual-pathway model,
            particularly in preschool-age populations.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The unemployment rate is very high in Kenya, with approximately 25% of the youth between
            the ages of 15 and 25 being currently unemployed (GOK, 2007). Some entrepreneurship
            education scholars believe that entrepreneurship education can alleviate the problem
            of high unemployment among the Kenyan youth. However, we do know other factors are
            likely to influence students’ decisions of starting their own business. The influence
            of entrepreneurship education as well as other factors known to affect entrepreneurial
            self-efficacy (ESE) is, however, under-researched at the secondary level in Kenya.
            The current study therefore employs quantitative methods in examining how students’
            business education exposure influences their ESE controlling for tribe/ethnic culture,
            family entrepreneurship history, prior entrepreneurship experience, family socio-economic
            status (SES), the type of school the students are attending, and their gender, as
            well as the extent at which family SES and gender moderate the influence of business
            studies education on ESE.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Recent research suggests that stress and reward insensitivity may interact to confer
            risk for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). However, no study has yet examined stress
            and reward sensitivity, and their interaction, in the context of risk for antenatal
            depression (i.e., depression in pregnancy). The present study is the first study to
            examine whether the neural response to reward (i.e., the Reward Positivity, or RewP),
            stress exposure as indexed by hair cortisol and self-report, and their interaction,
            are associated with antenatal depressive symptoms and/or categorical diagnoses of
            MDD, above and beyond self-report measures of psychosocial risk for perinatal depression.
            To this end, the present study examined cross-sectional associations between biological
            and psychosocial measures obtained in pregnancy, such as RewP amplitude, hair cortisol
            concentration, self-reported psychosocial risk factors (i.e., past major depressive
            episodes (MDE) and scores on a psychosocial risk factor questionnaire), and concurrent
            depressive symptoms and diagnoses. While the RewP was unrelated to stress exposure
            and to continuous depressive symptoms, and stress did not moderate associations between
            the RewP and continuous or categorical depression, associations were revealed between
            stress exposure and continuous depression, as well as between the RewP and categorical
            depression. Furthermore, the RewP and scores on self-report measure of common psychosocial
            risk factors for perinatal depression were identified in a logistic regression as
            independent predictors of antenatal diagnoses of MDD, and together predicted 37 percent
            of the variance in likelihood of MDD diagnosis. The present study provides novel evidence
            that the RewP is associated with MDD diagnoses in women in the antenatal period and
            highlights the need for further research investigating the RewP as a prospective predictor
            of risk for perinatal increases in depression.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Theories of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) have long guided treatment and
            prevention efforts. Meta-analytic investigation into general risk factors, psychopathology,
            and STB related clinical instruments indicated chance level prediction, and some researchers
            have suggested that a shift toward a machine learning approach would yield superior
            STB prediction. Thus, I conducted a meta-analysis of traditional theories and machine
            learning models to estimate and compare respective accuracy. I searched PsycInfo,
            PubMed, and GoogleScholar for studies using at least one theoretically relevant construct
            or machine learning model associated with suicide ideation, attempt, or death. This
            yielded 224 traditional (from 142 papers) and 14 machine learning (from 10 papers)
            effect sizes. Prediction from constructs related to traditional theories was consistent
            with previous meta-analytic work indicating weak, inaccurate prediction. No particular
            theory was particularly accurate in prediction of STB outcomes. Machine learning models
            demonstrated substantially more accurate association with STB outcomes, although these
            data are few in numbers. This work demonstrated that STB theories have largely not
            been directly tested in the extant literature and that moderators of machine learning
            models are largely unclear. Future studies are needed to directly test STB theories
            in order to stringently test these ideas. More machine learning studies are needed
            to investigate characteristics of extremely accurate models.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation is a collection of essays that employ experimental economic methodology
            in a variety of settings to address important uses of microeconomic and macroeconomic
            public policy. Chapter 1 serves as a forward to the remaining chapters. It highlights
            the importance of experimental economics to policy decisions and its unique place
            in the overall field of economics. Chapter 2 of this dissertation explores the influence
            of the ratchet effect on a bureaucracy's expansion and the resulting consequences.
            To examine the individual effects of adverse selection and moral hazard, Chapter 3
            uses an experimental method to study how asymmetric information affects individual
            behavior when insurance is present. Finally, Chapter 4 addresses the claim that money
            is neutral and its arbitrary injection into a market has no distributional effects.
            Throughout this dissertation, experimental economic methodologies will be employed
            in an array of economic fields demonstrating the broad applicability of experimental
            economics.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Polymer matrix composites are increasingly used in aerospace applications due to their
            high specific properties. Recently, wide application of composite materials leads
            to extensive research in improving manufacturing processes to increase production
            quality as well as potentially reduce cost. In addition, adding new functionality
            such as sensing, communication, lightning strike protection into composite structures
            to make multifunctional composites has gained more and more interests. Incorporation
            of functionalities triggers the development of integration technologies as well as
            innovate manufacturing approaches such as 3D printing or additive manufacturing. In
            this research, the design and fabrication of multifunctional composites by using different
            techniques including in-situ curing, 3D printing, and printed sensor network on composite
            structures are studied. In-situ curing in CNT/CF hybrid composites is presented in
            this work as an effective technique to manufacture multifunctional composites. By
            passing electrical current through highly conductive CNT layers, composite is fully
            cured by heat generated from CNT layers. FEM simulation is used to demonstrate uniformity
            of composite temperature which was in good agreement with the experiment result. In
            addition, 3D printing of functional ink using graphite nanoplatelets and milled carbon
            fiber is discussed. We successfully formulated conductive ink with thermal conductivity
            of 2W/mK and a density of 1.21 g/cm3. This research also introduced a new way of fabricating
            lightweight heat sink for thermal management by a combination of 3D printing technology
            with carbon nanotube sheet. Our heat sink offered effective thermal performance and
            extremely lightweight. Results indicate that the techniques are effective ways to
            transfer the properties of CNT sheets into lightweight thermal devices for thermal
            management applications. Furthermore, this work demonstrated feasibility and preliminary
            results of a fully printed wireless sensor that can potentially operate, monitor and
            transfer high quality of signal such as a change in relative permittivity. The sensors
            can effectively detect the change in permittivity of the environment Printed wireless
            sensor could open cost-effective and efficient way to monitor the large composite
            structure or manufacturing process.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Alcohol abuse is more prevalent in populations in which sleep deprivation is more
            common including shift workers and older individuals. While much research has investigated
            the impact of alcohol use and abuse on sleep quality, little is known about the role
            of sleep in alcohol sensitivity and toxicity. Using Drosophila melanogaster, a well-established
            model for sleep and alcohol studies, I investigated the modulating effect of sleep
            on alcohol sensitivity, toxicity, and tolerance. Mechanical sleep deprivation increased
            alcohol sensitivity and alcohol-induced mortality following an acute binge-like exposure
            to alcohol. Genetically sleep deficient flies exhibited increased alcohol-induced
            mortality which accumulated with age, but not increased alcohol sensitivity. Conversely,
            pharmacologically increasing sleep protects against the toxic effects of alcohol.
            Sleep deprivation blunted long-term but not short-term functional alcohol tolerance.
            Finally, sleep deprivation, alcohol exposure, and the combination of sleep deprivation
            and alcohol exposure induce both distinct and overlapping changes in gene expression.
            Taken together, the results of this study suggest that sleep modulates alcohol toxicity
            and impacts functional alcohol tolerance. This study lays the foundation for a future
            in-depth investigation of potential mechanisms governing the interaction of sleep
            and alcohol.

            has financial implications for school leaders in these West African international
            schools. The costs of recruiting teachers continue to soar and soak up school financial
            resources. International schools offer benefits when hiring teachers that include
            settling-in packages, shipping allowances, and costs associated with providing housing.
            Improved teacher retention would have a positive impact on school budgets and free
            funds for other resources that impact student learning. Many factors impact a teacher’s
            decision to stay or leave the school in which they work. Some of the areas that research
            has proven to be important include relationships with administration, geographical
            location, salary and benefits, and family and personal reasons. This study focused
            on the importance of the principal-teacher relationship role when teachers decide
            to stay or leave their small West African international schools and how the impact
            of the challenges that are faced by expatriate teachers affect the importance of that
            relationship. The findings of this study showed that the perception of the quality
            of life differentiated the stayers and leavers. The leavers could not overcome the
            challenges they faced in West Africa. The stayers did not have to overcome these challenges;
            they simply did not experience the challenges. Instead, they valued the positive relationships
            with principals, teachers, students, and community members. Good salary and benefits,
            professional development, and support were also important. Most teachers had a positive
            relationship with their principal regardless of their decision to stay or leave, but
            the difference for the stayers, this relationship was the determining factor, while
            for the leavers, it was not as they valued the independence, travel, and social life
            beyond school.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Anxiety disorders affect more than 40 million Americans and represent a significant
            public health and individual burden. The existing literature supports intolerance
            of uncertainty (IU) as an important transdiagnostic risk factor in the development
            and maintenance of anxiety-related disorders. Individuals high in IU react negatively
            to uncertainty, believe they are unable to cope with future unknowns, and consider
            uncertainty itself threatening. Given the robust association between IU and anxiety-related
            disorders, developing interventions designed to reduce IU is important. Experimental
            research has shown that IU can be mitigated; however, the extant work has yet to design
            and examine the efficacy of a comprehensive IU-focused intervention. The aim of the
            current proposal was to develop and test the efficacy of a brief IU-focused psychoeducation
            intervention in comparison to a control intervention. The sample consisted of 84 undergraduate
            individuals with elevated levels of IU as measured by the Intolerance of Uncertainty
            Scale, Short Form (IUS-12). Participants were randomly assigned to the active (IU-focused
            Psychoeducation) or control (Health-focused Psychoeducation) condition. Results revealed
            that the active condition did not lead to reductions in IU from pre- to post-intervention
            or from pre-intervention to week one follow-up. However, IU was significantly reduced
            from pre-intervention to month one follow-up in the active condition in comparison
            to control. This same of pattern of findings was found at month one follow-up within
            the active condition for symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder and levels of negative
            affect. Results of the present study are discussed in terms of clinical implications
            and directions for future research.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Prebiotic processes required a reliable source of free energy and complex chemical
            mixtures that likely included sugars. The formose reaction is a potential source of
            those sugars but is tied to alkaline conditions and elevated temperatures, under which
            these sugars rapidly decay. Here we show that calcium, barium and iron based chemical
            gardens catalyze the formose reaction to produce glucose, ribose, and other carbohydrates.
            These thin inorganic membranes are analogs of hydrothermal vent materials—a possible
            place for the origin of life—and similarly exposed to very steep pH gradients. Supported
            by simulations of a simple reaction-diffusion model, we show that such gradients allow
            for the dynamic accumulation of sugars in specific layers of the thin membrane. This
            spatial separation of sugar production and accumulation might have been one of the
            earliest examples of pre-biological compartmentalization.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Our research aimed at exploiting spectroscopic techniques in order to characterize
            and determine the electronic and vibrational properties of chromium(VI) oxides (precursor
            to the Phillips catalyst) dispersed on an amorphous silica support for the sake of
            investigating the Phillips catalyst system. In addition to characterizing the Cr(VI)/SiO2
            just mentioned, we focus on analyzing the mechanistic pathway the sites undertake
            to becoming catalytically active. Catalytic activation of the material involves a
            redox reaction with either carbon monoxide (CO) gas or ethylene (C2H4) gas to reduce
            the chromium to a labile, open-faced Cr(II)/Si. These highly reactive Cr(II) sites
            react with ethylene almost instantaneously to form the active sites for polymerization.
            An old sol-gel method previously developed for this system was used for the synthesis
            of our Cr(VI)/Si xerogel materials.17,18 These sol-gels provide higher quality spectroscopic
            resolution at lower concentrations and are isotropic and non-scattering which allows
            the use of polarization studies. These factors allow for a superior investigation
            through spectroscopy. Raman, resonance Raman, and low temperature fluorescent techniques
            were used for investigating the vibrational properties of the initial Cr(VI)/Si as
            well as the material after onset of polymerization. UV-Vis and fluorescent spectroscopy
            were used for analyzing the electronic properties of the initial Cr(VI) as well as
            studying the reduction of the chromium and polymerization via C2H4(g). In-situ electron
            paramagnetic resonance (EPR) assisted in analyzing the oxidation state of our chromium
            material during the different stages of the preparation and initiation. The electronic
            and vibrational modes of the Cr(VI)/Si precursor were assigned with the help of a
            collaborator from FSU whom performed computational studies We assign the electronic
            structure to a dioxoCr(VI) species with two terminal Cr=O bonds and two Cr-O-Si bridging
            networks. The possibility of other species claimed to potentially be present was tested
            and no spectroscopic evidence was observed for any species other than the dioxoCr.
            The Chromium is observed to reduce to Cr(II) through an intermediate Cr(IV) via CO
            reduction. It is then observed to oxidize to an organoCr(III)/Si after exposure to
            ethylene and formation of the active sites for polymerization. Reduction using ethylene
            is still less understood, but is hypothesized to go through the same oxidation states
            and is experimentally observed to be consistent with the CO method in terms of polymer
            produced and Cr(III) active sites. As to the type of Cr structure present after initiation,
            we identify the presence of a vinylCr(III) species and present a proposal for the
            mechanism of initiation for the Phillips catalyst.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Nonspecific interactions in biological media can lead to the formation of protein
            corona around nancolloids, which tend to alter their behavior and limit their utility
            when used as probes for imaging or sensing applications. Yet, understanding the corona
            buildup has been challenging. This dissertation focuses on understanding factors that
            govern corona formation and developing means to prevent such nonspecific adsorptions,
            using semiconductor and metallic nanocrystals as model nanocolloid systems. In Chapter
            1 we showcase the intrinsic photophysical properties of quantum dots (QDs) and gold
            nanocrystals (AuNCs), along with the growth mechanisms and synthetic routes. In addition,
            we introduce the definition of “protein corona”, hard vs soft, factors that affect
            the corona composition, and its impact on biology and environment. We also provide
            an overview of the analytical techniques used and promising strategies applied in
            investigating and preventing nonspecific protein adsorptions, respectively. In Chapter
            2 we investigate the role of surface coating on the promotion or prevention of protein
            corona around QDs, where we carefully vary the nature of the hydrophilic block in
            the surface coating, while maintaining the same dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) bidentate
            coordinating motif. We first use agarose gel electrophoresis to track changes in the
            mobility shift upon exposure of the QDs to protein-rich media. We find that QDs capped
            with DHLA (which presents a hydrophobic alkyl chain terminated with a carboxyl group)
            could promote corona formation, in a concentration-dependent manner. However, when
            a polyethylene glycol block or a zwitterion group is appended onto DHLA, it yields
            a coating that prevents corona build-up. Additional gel experiments using SDS-PAGE
            allowed further characterization of the corona protein when formed. We find that for
            coating strategy based on the bidentate motif, only soft corona form around the DHLA-capped
            QDs. In chapter 3 we investigate the nonspecific protein adsorptions on AuNPs, where
            we strategically modify the ligand structures of a series of DHLA-based ligands. We
            use agarose gel electrophoresis to monitor any potential corona formation on AuNPs
            when exposed to bovine serum albumin (BSA) or fetal bovine serum (FBS). We find that
            AuNPs capped with dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA, a small alkyl-COOH) are prone to interactions
            with proteins, while capping AuNPs with polyethylene glycol- or zwitterion-appended
            DHLA significantly reduces corona buildup. Supplementing measurements using UV-Vis
            spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering have allowed further characterization of
            the role and the binding kinetics of these protein adsorptions. Our results clearly
            show that surface chemistry of the NP and the nature of the core material plays a
            significant role in corona formation. In chapter 4 we describe the effect of shape
            of gold nanocrystals on corona formation using nanospheres, nanostars, and nanorods.
            Such nanocrystals functionalized with poly(ethylene glycol), poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic
            anhydride) (PIMA), and PEG-appended PIMA induce or discourage nonspecific protein
            adsorptions depending on the surface coating used and the nature of the shape. We
            show that the presence of PEG moieties significantly inhibits the corona formation
            when exposed to complex fluids, independent to the shape of nanocrystals. We find
            that in absence of PEG, the shape of nanocrystals strongly intervenes with interactions
            at the nano-bio interface. Additionally, we show that the effect of shape on corona
            buildup prevails under different temperatures, a result that contributes highly to
            designing corona-free nanocrystals. In chapter 5 we include a summary of the findings
            and implications described in this dissertation, along with a discussion of the future
            outlook in the corona science.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Defected customers cost U.S. companies over $62 billion in 2016, $42 billion more
            than 2013 (Hyken 2016). To combat these losses, firms increasingly engage with these
            defectors in an effort to cultivate a fruitful second-lifetime. In a two-study, multimethod
            design based on a customer-company identification theory framework, this research
            introduces identity-based customer defection. Although many customers defect due to
            the lackluster performance by the company as typically studied in extant research
            (a performance-based defection), this research proposes that some defect due to a
            perceived mismatch between their identities and their perceptions of a firm’s identity
            (an identity-based defection). Because of their unique defection reasons, strategies
            that are effective for performance-based defectors may be ineffective for identity-based
            defectors. Study 1 utilizes twelve years of firm-provided, longitudinal data on 1,390
            defected customers to demonstrate that whereas win-back communications are effective
            for recovering performance-based defectors, loyalty communications, those focused
            on reinforcing the positive, non-economic aspects of the firm, are more effective
            for identity-based defectors. A follow-up study focused on second-lifetime value demonstrates
            that identity-based defectors represent more revenue in their second-lifetimes when
            they receive loyalty communications after defection. Based on self-affirmation theory,
            experimental data in Study 2 support the idea that loyalty communications address
            perceived incompatibility between the defector’s identity and the identity of the
            firm. Findings suggest that after a firm makes a decision that may affect perceptions
            of its identity, it should remind customers about the various ways in which the company’s
            identity is still attractive.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Forty-three percent of all international college students in the United States enroll
            in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs. In 2014, the
            Caribbean sent the highest proportion of female students (44%) to study STEM in the
            United States. Even though minority women in STEM must construct science identities
            to persist in STEM, Afro-Caribbean women tend not to be featured in research on STEM
            diversity and participation. Afro-Caribbean women have constructed personal and collective
            identities crucial to science identity construction outside of the U.S. in unique
            sociocultural contexts where Black is dominant and British-styled instruction remains
            intact. As a result, Afro-Caribbean women in STEM, while existing in a unique bifurcation
            of hypervisibility and invisibility resulting from multiple and intersecting identities,
            experience for the first time the “triple threat” minoritizing effects of being Black,
            female, and international/non-immigrant both in predominantly White institutions and
            the wider U.S. society. This research examines how triple threat experiences might
            facilitate or constrain science identity construction for Afro-Caribbean women in
            STEM. Using grounded theory, this dissertation proposes a model of science identity
            construction that attends to the intersectionality of Afro-Caribbean women’s experiences
            in STEM.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This research investigates the adoption of smartwatches within the running community.
            By using a mixed methods design consisting of quantitative surveys and qualitative
            interviews, this study asks runners what factors influence their adoption of smartwatches,
            what information is valued and most utilized, and the impact of these devices on their
            behavior. This study primarily relies on Diffusion of Innovations theory as a lens
            through which to view the factors of adoption for runners, but it also utilizes questions
            from the Technology Acceptance Model to attempt to better understand the role of these
            devices within the running community. Through the utilization of surveys and interviews,
            this study identifies relative advantage to be the primary factor in adopting smartwatches
            and trialability to be an unimportant factor. Further, all interview participants
            in this study reported that smartwatches made them more aware of their behavior, and
            14 of 15 interview participants stated that their behavior and/or training regimens
            had changed due to data they obtained via smartwatches. The findings of this study
            suggest that more research is needed to determine whether these changes are temporary
            or part of a larger, permanent trend. Further, based on this study, there is a need
            for more research into the impact of smartwatches in other communities to determine
            whether the effect of smartwatches on behavior is isolated to athletes who are actively
            training or whether more fitness data and greater awareness of one’s activity spurs
            greater movement in the population more generally.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>People recall and recognize animate words better than inanimate words, possibly because
            memory systems were shaped by evolution to prioritize memory for predators, people,
            and food sources. However, the proximal cause of this animacy advantage is not yet
            known. Attentional paradigms show an animacy advantage in change detection tasks and
            in attentional blink tasks, which suggests that the animacy advantage in memory could
            stem from a prioritization of animate items when allocating attentional resources
            during encoding. In a series of three experiments, I replicate the animacy effect
            in a remember-know paradigm (Experiment 1), and test whether better recognition (Experiment
            2) and better recall (Experiment 3) for animate items can be traced to enhanced attention
            at encoding by comparing the animacy effect under conditions of full versus divided
            attention at encoding. Results demonstrate that word type does not interact with attention
            condition, suggesting that attention is not the proximal cause of the animacy effect
            in memory.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation asks new questions about the figure of the demagogue as cultural
            production. How did the concept of the demagogue emerge and manifest itself in the
            public imagination during the American Revolution and what relationship does it have
            to revolution? Who was using this term and to what end? What cultural materials, both
            physical and discursive, go into the making of the demagogue as a figure of political
            literature? What factors make the character not only intelligible and applicable in
            a modern political era when the people are considered the source of all legitimate
            authority? I argue that elites during the American Revolution struggled to make sense
            of the popular movements of the 1760s, and they used the figure of the demagogue as
            an aesthetic expression, a way of coming to terms with the realities of a popular
            political revolution. Over the course of the revolution and afterwards in the run-up
            to the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the figure of the demagogue became a rhetorical
            device that elites used to intervene on public opinion of convince audiences of the
            dangers posed by democratic political relationships. More importantly, the demagogue
            registers a fundamental contradiction of modern political reality. In an era of popular
            sovereignty, when the people are considered the source of authority, those who aspire
            to power must both lead and be led by the people. The idea that the people have authority
            over their leaders is in contradiction with the idea that leaders have authority over
            the people. This is a foundational contradiction of modern political relationships
            that animates political movements as much as it animates the imagination. That the
            demagogue re-emerged in the popular imagination is a direct result of this contradiction.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>According to 2017 CDC statistics (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), 1 in
            10 infants in the United States are born prematurely. Preterm infants may demonstrate
            a delay in reaching developmental milestones due to extended hospitalization; however,
            developmental-based programs like music therapy may offset these delays. Limited research
            exists exploring follow-up services to offset developmental delays for infants admitted
            into the NICU upon discharge. The purpose of this study was to survey current music
            therapists to determine the current needs in the NICU, as well as provide research
            to assist in the development of follow-up music therapy interventions post discharge.
            Twenty-eight board certified music therapists who have or currently do work in the
            NICU participated in an online survey. Participants’ responses indicated that all
            participants completed NICU-MT training, with more than half reporting both having
            1-3 years of experience as well as working with a minimum of 7 infants per week. The
            majority of the participants reported providing parent training in the NICU as well
            as educational resources prior to discharge. Lastly, the majority of participants
            responded in agreement regarding the potential benefit for follow-up music therapy
            services post-discharge.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Examining suicide risk in the context of new technological advances is vital to informing
            suicide prevention efforts. Previous research has shown associations between internet
            use for harmful suicide-related purposes (e.g., increasing knowledge about lethal
            means) and higher suicide risk. The current study examined these associations by testing
            the relationship between harmful suicide-related internet use and higher suicide risk
            in a longitudinal design among a sample of undergraduates (n = 44, 75% female, 63.6%
            White/Caucasian/European American, 75% Heterosexual/Straight) and a sample of current
            and former military personnel (n = 88, 78.4% male, 69.3% White/Caucasian/European
            American, 55.7% Heterosexual/Straight). The research examined the association between
            baseline suicidal ideation, baseline suicide intent, number of previous suicide attempts,
            fearlessness about death, implicit suicide risk, and harmful suicide-related internet
            use. The study also examined whether harmful-suicide related internet use predicts
            higher suicidal ideation, higher suicide intent, increased fearlessness about death,
            and larger implicit associations between the self and suicide/death at a four-week
            follow-up. Findings did not support the effects of harmful suicide-related internet
            use on outcomes associated with suicide or fearlessness about death in either sample;
            however, results were limited by the small sample size and inconsistent responding.
            Further studies are needed to further clarify the role of harmful suicide-related
            internet use and suicide risk.

            in urban secondary schools as compared to teaching in rural and suburban public and
            charter schools to provide greater clarity to help prepare preservice music educators.
            The participants (N = 61) in this study were music educators teaching choral music
            in public/charter middle or high schools in the state of Tennessee during the 2018-2019
            academic school year. The results indicated that parental engagement was perceived
            as the greatest issue while administrative support was the least issue. The results
            also indicated the majority of participants believed urban schools better address
            classroom management issues and provides more school funding when compared to rural
            schools. Conversely, participants believe that rural schools provide more administrative
            support and parental support respectively compared to urban schools. For the results
            comparing urban schools to suburban schools, participants indicated they believe school
            funding, school climate, parental engagement, and administrative support are better
            addressed or provided for by suburban schools.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>There are four main topics that drive conversations in small towns: births, weddings,
            deaths, and rumors. In my hometown, in the dead-center of Florida, most rumors revolve
            around strange deaths and murders. This fascination with the grotesque serves as the
            focal point of my manuscript. However, I also want to explore different characters
            who are either members of the “Rumor Mill” or subjects of their whispered meetings,
            as well as describe significant landmarks, which will increase the realism of the
            manuscript, despite the absurdity. Throughout my project, I examine what makes “my
            own little postage stamp” of the world, to borrow Faulkner’s phrase, unique through
            descriptive poems of the area, persona poems for the characters, and poems focusing
            on the most intriguing deaths and murders. My manuscript, tentatively titled Polk
            County Death Parade, explores the misunderstood aspects of small towns in central
            Florida. The town that serves as the focal point for my manuscript appears to be a
            perfectly normal town with picturesque houses, churches every quarter mile, and people
            unafraid to walk at any time of day. However, my manuscript challenges this idyllic
            surface. I explain the reality of my town by dissecting the landmarks, characters,
            and strange deaths that serve as fodder for the rumors and local legends. I want to
            create a tone that falls between The Twilight Zone and Mayberry, with nods to David
            Lynch and Flannery O’Connor. To achieve this tone, I will incorporate lessons from
            both poets and fiction writers to help me create the narratives and descriptions that
            accompany voice driven murder stories. I admire Billy Collins’ approach to dark topics
            with a light tone, Flannery O’Connor’s hyper-realistic characters, and Andrew Huggins’
            connection to regionality. I also want to incorporate Dorothy Allison’s belief in
            treating all of her characters with respect, never writing as if they are lesser people
            even if their actions are reprehensible. Similarly, I want to follow Larry Brown’s
            lead in creating places, characters, and voices that sound, if not familiar, then
            at least honest, for readers in and out of the South. Although not all of my poems
            will be focused on characterization or will be persona poems, my goal for this manuscript
            is to be a Southern counterpart to Edgar Lee Masters’ Spoon River Anthology. The town
            and people are based on my own experiences or rumors I grew up hearing, but fictionalized
            just enough to enhance the natural strangeness. This exploration into small town life
            will illustrate the universality of searching for humor in dark situations, explore
            a natural fascination with the grotesque, and a guilty pleasure found through the
            creation of local legends and rumors. While the characters, places, and actions are
            unique to the manuscript, the themes, emotions, and situations stretch well beyond
            the city limit signs. Readers do not have to be intimately familiar with Southern
            small towns to connect with the characters, create an image the town for themselves,
            and become invested in the murders. I illustrate snap shots of humanity and explore
            experiences that, while specific to my town still connect with people who have never
            lived in a small town. Deaths, murders, and questionable characters serve as common
            ground between my manuscript and a wide readership. Rather than limiting the reach
            of my project, the intimate connection to region helps to illustrate commonalities
            of the human experience of dissecting the strange and unusual experiences of their
            own hometowns. There are three major types of poems which make up my project, which
            will be a singular piece without sections or chapters. The majority of the manuscript
            is dedicated to exploring the deaths and murders through a darkly humorous tone to
            illustrate the natural strangeness of the town and to explore the theme of death through
            a non-sentimental lens. Interspersed throughout the death poems will be persona poems;
            some from the point-of-view of town-characters to give context regarding who lives
            in this area, some from the point-of-view of the deceased, and some from the point-of-view
            of the murderers. These voice-driven poems will not only contextualize the people
            who make up the town, but will work to explore dark situations from unusual perspectives.
            Additionally, I will include poems dedicated to the important landmarks throughout
            the town, such as the most popular bar, the park with an alligator filled lake, and
            what is generously referred to as the local country club. These poems ingratiate the
            reader to the town, explaining not only the geography, but to make the reader feel
            as if they are a part of the town as well. My manuscript opens with “They’re Good
            People, Babe,” a voice-driven poem outlining the types of people and situations readers
            will encounter throughout the project, followed by a poem detailing some of the places
            and people readers will encounter again as the project progresses. These opening poems
            will help to ground the reader in the reality of the project, giving them context
            before they fall into the realm of rumor and hearsay. My manuscript will continue
            the Southern gothic tradition of telling the stories of people who otherwise would
            go unnoticed. In the same way Brown, Allison, and O’Connor write about the people
            who exist on the periphery of society, I want to tell the stories that otherwise would
            never be told. I hope to obscure the line between realism and surrealism, truth and
            the absurd, the courtroom transcripts and the surrounding rumors. Picasso says “Art
            is the lie that tells the truth.” Therefore, although aspects of these poems will
            be based on true events, I will create an alternate universe for them, blurring the
            barriers between fact and fiction. The importance of this project lies with the characters
            whose stories deserve to be told, but with changes to protect the survivors.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Despite the critical role of school leaders in supporting teachers and improving student
            learning and the importance of ensuring qualified candidates to enter school leadership
            positions, perceptions and experiences of related to the career pathways of leadership
            preparation program completers into leadership are not yet fully understood. This
            mixed-methods study conducted a survey of 36 graduates and interviews of 9 graduates
            who graduated from the Florida State University’s Educational Leadership and Administration
            (EDA) master’s, specialist, and modified certificate programs between fall 2012 and
            summer 2018 to examine their career decision and experience with seeking and securing
            an assistant principal (AP) position. The study identified three career pathways—pathway
            1: the graduates who have never applied for an AP position (17 or 47%), pathway 2:
            the graduates who have applied and secured an AP position (11 or 31%), and pathway
            3: the graduates who have applied but not secured an AP position (8 or 22%). The main
            reasons for not applying for an AP position included: 1) Less time at home with family
            members (2.0); 2) Difficulty maintaining work-life balance (2.0); and 3) Less personal
            time (1.8). . Interview data revealed the differences between the graduates in pathways
            2 and 3 were the availability and the use of positive relationship with school leaders
            and district leaders to build their reputation. While both groups were aware of the
            district eligibility requirements to apply for an AP position, group 2’s ability to
            capitalize on those established relationships to gain feedback and clear guidance
            on how to secure an AP position was a difference between the two groups. Another difference
            identified was group 2’s perception of their district’s hiring process, which included
            multiple rejections similar to group 3, was one of understanding while group 3’s perception
            was one of discouragement and skepticism of the process. An important implication
            of this study is for program completers to understand impactful factors that could
            potentially affect their career decisions upon completion of their EDA program, the
            research to support the job searching experiences to secure an AP position, and the
            necessary support to gain a comprehensive understanding of best practices to support
            their efforts to secure an AP position. An additional implication of this study is
            for program faculty to have an understanding of extenuating factors that could affect
            the career decisions of their students and to integrate evidence based methods of
            support to ensure students are leaving the program with realistic expectations to
            successfully secure an AP position, how to capitalize on available resources to fully
            understand the path to apply and secure an AP position, and knowledge of what they
            may encounter in the application and interview process to build resiliency and perseverance
            in the midst of possible rejections. KEY TERMS: Career Pathways, Assistant Principal

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Purpose: To establish the relationship between the acute:chronic workload ratio and
            peak performance in division 1 NCAA track and field sprinters over the course of the
            2018 outdoor season. Methods: The acute:chronic workload ratio was determined by calculating
            the sum of the week before the competition’s session rating of perceived exertion
            of training load (acute load) and dividing it by the average weekly session rating
            of perceived exertion of training load over the previous four weeks (chronic workload).
            All ratings of perceived exertion were self-reported through an Athlete Management
            System (AMS) no later than one hour after the training session or competition. The
            sprinters’ race times were recorded through an online data base and, in the primary
            statistical analysis, were analyzed for confounding variables. Once the confound variables
            were established, Pearson correlations were used covarying for the confounding variables.
            Our hypothesis was that there would be a positive relationship between the acute:chronic
            workload ratio and the 100m and 200m race times. In a secondary analysis, violating
            the statistical assumption of independence, the acute:chronic workload ratio was correlated
            to the sum of all data points for male and female 100m and 200m race times and the
            male and female 100m and 200m Z-scores for each sprinter. Bins were created with the
            hypothesis that having an acute:chronic workload ratio between 0.8 and 1.3 would be
            correlated with lower race times in the 100m and 200m races and more negative Z-scores
            for the 100m and 200m races. Results: A lower acute:chronic workload ratio resulted
            in a moderate positive correlation with lower race times in the 100m (R= 0.542) and
            200m (R= 0.711) races. Conclusions: Maintaining an acute:chronic workload ratio between
            0.8 and 1.3 may be optimal for elite division 1 NCAA track and field sprinters to
            reach their peak performance in the 100m and 200m races. An individualized approach
            to training load using the acute:chronic workload ratio should help coaches and performance
            staff with individualized training-load planning and prescription for the sprinters
            to reach peak performance.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Sonic experiences of a place are both personal and collective. They are derived from
            affectual encounters in that place in the everyday. The sounds of a place provide
            detail on the culture, development, and environment. Geographers have often overlooked
            the role of individual experiences with sound in places for developing our perspective
            on natural spaces. The visual has offered geographers a great deal of material and
            meaning in terms of the study of the landscape and personal connections to place.
            This focus on the material, concrete, and visual aspects of society has often denied
            the sense of hearing. However, sound is part of embodied everyday experience of places
            and cannot be separated from affectual experiences or the spaces in which sound is
            heard. This contributes to shaping culture. Though research into the soundscape and
            sonic experiences has been the focus in various disciplines, research in geography
            is lacking an appreciation of the role of place in exploring sonic experiences. The
            role of sound and music in geography often takes the form of production and distribution
            of music and its economics and politics. But with little attention to the role of
            the sound or affect. Therefore, this dissertation sheds light on the role of the soundscape
            and the spatiality of sound in the construction of place. It also explores the role
            that affectual encounters in natural everyday spaces have on the individual and their
            place development. As a starting point, the dissertation seeks to develop a theoretical
            framework underpinned by geography, musicology, and sound studies to help describe
            the affective capacity of sound in place. Developing the concept of affect beyond
            the traditional realm of non-representational theory, the dissertation incorporates
            concepts of emotion and affect to explain the development of place through sound.
            Reaching into various theoretical frameworks, including behavioral geography, sonic
            geography, geography of music, representational theory, non-representational theory,
            participant observation, and reflexivity, it creates a more unified conceptualization
            of everyday sonic experiences of place by developing an approach which moves affective
            sonic encounters beyond the representational. These theoretical underpinnings are
            demonstrated by an empirical multi-modal approach to the study of sound in place.
            It uses a case study that provides a vehicle to explore how affect and emotion are
            experienced in nature through sound and place using sound journals, historical/archival
            data, sound recordings, and participatory observation. The fieldwork was conducted
            while sailing along the Hudson River in the US state of New York during the summer
            of 2017. The sites where data were collected complement those recorded by Annea Lockwood
            for her composition, A Sound Map of the Hudson River (1983). The archival material
            on texts written about the river was found from various historical sources, and interviews
            were provided by Lockwood. The locations chosen for recording sounds include various
            cultural, social, economic, industrial and environmental developments along the river.
            The recordings from Lockwood’s CD and the six interviews she conducted in 1982 offer
            a starting point to describe the construction of place through sound. The four journals
            collected with crewmembers of the Gail Frances on the river as well as my own observations
            from the Hudson River provide a better conceptualization of participants’ affective
            experiences through sound as they are immersed in the places they describe. The historical
            interviews and recordings from 1982 were paired with the journals and recordings from
            2017 to emphasize how sound of the natural environment elicits powerful affective
            experiences that molds an individual’s sense of place. Through the participants’ interviews
            and journals, it is clear that there are some aspects of the soundscape that have
            become essential to the discussion of a place and often recreate a sense of nostalgia
            with almost a spiritual sensation. Other aspects of the sounds of the places along
            that Hudson River remind participants of the divisions between the human and the natural
            environments, and that there are different perspectives to the river depending on
            an individual’s approach. The participants’ encounters also carried a common theme
            of everyday experience and survival as these were individuals who depended upon the
            river. From these interviews, journals, and recordings, it is clear that one role
            of space and sound is in mediation of the affective encounters that individuals endure
            in place, which inspires emotional experiences. My study demonstrates that sound is
            an essential aspect of the experience of place and can be explored geographically,
            thus providing a framework for future research and an empirical, geographical examination
            of individual sonic experiences within a natural environment.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In an attempt to improve treatment adherence in type 2 diabetes patients, researchers
            are turning to the couple system as one potential point of intervention. However,
            due to the lack of knowledge surrounding the role general relationship processes have
            in influencing diabetes management behaviors, very few couple-based interventions
            exist. Therefore, the current pilot study assesses the potential importance, and feasibility,
            of examining dyadic coping processes in the context of diabetes management and support
            among couples where one partner has type 2 diabetes. Preliminary findings suggest
            dyadic coping processes of both partners may be important in helping understand how
            general couple relationship processes can be used as a point of intervention for treating
            type 2 diabetes. However, a full-scale study is not feasible without adaptations to
            the current study protocol, measurements, recruitment procedures and funding.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation examines how technology and aesthetics impact consumer decision
            making. The robotics literature has examined how features of robots such as the level
            of autonomy (Stein, Liebold, and Ohler 2019; Złotowski, Yogeeswaran, and Bartneck
            2017) and humanoid design elements (Mende et al. forthcoming) impact consumer decision
            making and how consumers respond to robots. Moreover, Bagchi and Cheema (2013) examined
            how aesthetic features influence consumer decision making. I seek to add to this literature
            in two Essays in this dissertation. Essay 1 examines how technology in a service setting
            affects a consumer’s compliance and loyalty intentions. Essay 2 examines consumer
            decision making in a different context and outcome by studying how an aesthetic feature
            of a brand identifier, cuteness, influences consumer willingness to pay. Essay 1 introduces
            a new concept to the marketing literature, cobotic teams, in an examination of the
            effect of technology on consumer decision making. More specifically, Essay 1 examines
            if a robot-led, as compared to a human-led, cobotic team has implications for a consumer’s
            compliance and loyalty intentions. Essay 1 finds that consumers have lower compliance
            and loyalty intentions to a robot-led cobotic team as compared to a human-led cobotic
            team. Moreover, Essay 1 uncovers that a serial mediation of an increase in anxiety,
            leading to a decrease in warmth and competence mediates this relationship. In an examination
            of how to attenuate this effect, power distance belief, risk acceptance, and perceived
            control are demonstrated moderators. Essay 2 builds on the cuteness literature examining
            a potential downside to the use of cuteness; a decrease in willingness to pay. The
            results of Essay 2 demonstrate that consumers have a lower willingness to pay to a
            seller using a cute brand identifier, such as a logo or a mascot, as compared to a
            seller using a neutral brand identifier. Examining the process underlying this effect,
            Essay 2 uncovers that consumers experience an increase in intention to dominate the
            firm using a cute brand identifier, resulting in a decrease in willingness to pay.
            Essay 2 then offers conceptual extensions of the findings theorizing that the size
            of the seller, the strategic use of the brand identifier, and the agency of an accompanying
            message will moderate the basic effect. Thus, Essay 2 extends the understanding of
            consumer decision making as a result of a firm’s use of cuteness. While previous research
            has demonstrated that cuteness results in positive behaviors such as an increase in
            indulgent consumption (Nenkov and Scott 2014), heightened carefulness in behavior
            (Sherman, Haidt, and Coan 2009), and an increase in prosocial behavior (Wang, Mukhopadhyay,
            and Patrick 2017), Essay 2 suggests that the use of cuteness may have a backfiring
            effect that has financial implications for firms, a decrease in willingness to pay.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>How do local governments manage inter-governmental relationships in the context of
            urban sustainability? In an age of emerging impacts from global climate change and
            over-exploitation of natural resource, it is important to understand the role of local
            government in managing sustainability. Yet, sustainability is a complex area characterized
            as authority fragmentation which creates negative externalities and opportunistic
            behaviors. To better manage it, local governments rely on integrative actions such
            as inter-local collaborations and interactive exchange with higher level authorities,
            thus, embedding local governments in a nexus of inter-governmental relationships.
            However, gaps remain in our understanding of urban sustainability contexts and how
            local governments manage inter-governmental relationships to lower collaboration risks,
            share power, and reduce compliance burdens. Additionally it is important to identify
            what difference these relationships make for implementing federal grants, delivering
            services, and collaborative actions under different levels authority. This dissertation
            fills these gaps by investigating the structure of relationships among local governments
            in collaborative urban sustainability networks in both China and US and the perceptions
            of local governments to federal imposed rules and compliance while implementing one-shot
            federal sustainability program. The research findings suggest that: (1) local governments
            select collaborative partners strategically, depending upon the nature of collaborative
            relations, collaboration risks, and multiplexity of collaborations, which make networks
            demonstrate different configurations; (2) certain actors in the network are more powerful
            to administer the collaborative relationship due to possessing accesses to valuable
            resources such as political information, administrative capacity, funding, and innovative
            information; (3) local governments as grantees perceive rule compliance burden differently
            based on their relationships with federal grantor including goal congruence, resource
            dependence, and previous interactive relationships. In a one-shot grant, goal congruence
            and previous interactive relationships have significant effects on perceived compliance
            burden. Together these three studies add important new insights to our understanding
            of intergovernmental relations.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>CrgA is a small helical membrane protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and
            known to recruit other cell division proteins to the divisome, a substantial protein
            complex for Mtb cell division. There is a lack of information about the formation
            of the divisome, because most of the Mtb cell division proteins, including CrgA, do
            not have homologs in the traditional model bacteria, such as E. coli. Thus, structural
            information is needed to understand how these proteins interact and function in the
            divisome. However, small helical membrane proteins are such a challenging target for
            structural biology, because they are surrounded by the complex membrane environment,
            which has varying biophysical properties in terms of the dielectric constants, water
            concentration, fluidity, and a lateral pressure profile. The entire membrane protein
            does not experience the same environment, and therefore it is critical to understand
            the dynamics of each domain in order to characterize its structure. CrgA was characterized
            as having a cytoplasmic N-terminus (30 residues long) consisting of two dynamically
            different regions: an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and a β-strand. Even though
            most Mtb divisome proteins were predicted to have at least one IDR, the roles of IDRs
            in membrane proteins has not been fully explored. In this dissertation, different
            solid-state NMR techniques were used to characterize the water soluble regions such
            as IDRs of membrane proteins. Identifying a small portion of the protein in the lipid
            interfacial region is not feasible without providing a native-like lipid bilayer environment.
            The observation of the β-strand addressed the importance of the appropriate membrane
            mimetic to characterize the interfacial region of CrgA. Also, unambiguous interhelical
            distance restraints are essential for determining the correct tertiary and quaternary
            structure of a helical membrane protein. However, high contents of hydrophobic residues
            in the transmembrane domain make sequence specific assignments a difficult task, so
            various methods, such as specific isotope labeling schemes and mutagenesis were implemented
            to obtain the distance restraints. The sequence specific assignment strategies presented
            here for CrgA can be applied to other membrane protein systems. Combining the structural
            restraints from both magic angle spinning and oriented sample NMR led to the dimeric
            structure of CrgA using molecular dynamics simulations. Additionally, the mutagenesis
            data helped to define the dimeric interface for CrgA. In the case of CrgA, it is necessary
            to sort out any residues at the helix-helix interfacial region in the same monomer
            versus those located in the monomer-monomer interface of the dimer. Excluding those
            residues involved in the dimer interface will facilitate defining the lipid-facing
            residues available for CrgA’s binding partners. Since CrgA is a pivotal component
            of the divisome, the structure of CrgA will provide great insight into the formation
            of the divisome to advance knowledge about Mtb cell division.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Substance use disorders (SUDs) are a prevalent and impairing condition, particularly
            among trauma exposed individuals. The current proposal aimed to address the critical
            need for targeted direct SUD prevention in this population by intervening on a novel,
            malleable risk factor for SUD common among trauma-exposed individuals: sleep disturbance.
            Sleep disturbance prospectively predicts the development of SUD and may confer risk
            for SUD by increasing stress reactivity, decreasing decision-making abilities, and
            ultimately promoting substance use to relieve negative affect, a core etiological
            factor in SUD. However, to our knowledge, no experimental studies have determined
            whether improving sleep leads to reductions in SUD risk. As such, the current study
            used a randomized controlled trial design to test the effects of brief behavioral
            treatment for insomnia (BBTI) against a waitlist control among a sample of trauma-exposed
            young adults with poor sleep and risk for SUD (N = 68). Results indicated that BBTI
            was more effective than the waitlist control in reducing self-reported insomnia symptoms
            and sleep efficiency at Post-intervention, with medium to large effect sizes. Furthermore,
            reductions in insomnia symptoms mediated treatment effects on reducing coping-oriented
            cannabis use, PTSD symptoms, and cannabis-related problems. Future research should
            replicate these results in a larger sample, with longer-term follow-ups and improved
            retention rates. Overall, BBTI is a promising intervention for reducing insomnia symptoms,
            and, in turn, coping-oriented cannabis use, cannabis problems, and PTSD symptoms in
            at-risk cannabis users.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>There is a great deal of research about prisons, but there is a gap in research about
            jails in the correctional literature. This is particularly true for research about
            jail inmate reentry. Much of what is known is descriptive in nature, and there is
            a lack of focus on jail inmate reentry both in research and in practice, likely due
            to the many barriers associated with implementing jail-based reentry programming.
            Jails are organizations and as such can be studied using organizational theories,
            specifically functional systems analysis. This dissertation takes a functional systems
            analysis approach to provide an in-depth look at a large Central Florida Jail to understand
            its formally stated goals, how these goals work in practice, how they have changed
            over time, and whether this jail is achieving organizational efficiency and accomplishing
            its goals. This study examines three parts of this organization: (1) the organization
            as a whole, (2) the staff, and (3) the inmates. To do so, it makes use of three data
            sources and methods: (1) a content analysis of annual reports and strategic plans,
            (2) coding of in-depth qualitative interviews with jail staff, and (3) and quantitative
            analyses (OLS) of surveys of jail inmates. The annual reports and interviews of jail
            staff determine how the focus on reentry has changed over time at the organizational
            level and the inmate surveys examine the influence of reentry programming participation
            on inmate perceptions of post-release success, perceived importance of various reentry-related
            issues for staying out of jail, and inmate self-perceptions. The findings suggest
            that there has been an increased focus on reentry over the last two decades in this
            jail, as the jail has shifted its focus from being primarily interested in safety-related
            goals to being interested in rehabilitating inmates and helping them to successfully
            return to society. Despite this shift, results also show that the programs offered
            to inmates do not increase inmates’ perceived preparedness, perceived importance of
            reentry, or self-perceptions.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The present qualitative study explored college student responses to personal clay
            use or mindfulness-based art therapy (MBAT) twice a week for stress reduction. Participants
            were recruited from a larger art therapy study, in which the biological stress marker,
            cortisol, was tested following time spent playing with clay. This study was divided
            into two groups, a neutral clay group (NCT group) who solely played with clay for
            stress reduction, and an MBAT group, also given clay, but mindfulness exercises as
            well. Participants from both groups were chosen to be interviewed about their experience
            to compare perceptions. Interviews took place once at the start of the study, and
            a second time after the study was complete. The semi-structured interviews explored
            1) the nature of college student stress and stress management, 2) responses to MBAT
            on stress, anxiety, and general student functioning in the college setting, and 3)
            responses to personal clay use on stress, anxiety, and general student functioning
            in the college setting. Following thematic analysis of all interview transcriptions,
            differences were noted between those who engaged in personal clay use, combined with
            supplemental mindfulness exercises (MBAT group), and those who were provided solely
            with personal clay without prompts or guidance (Neutral Clay Task group; NCT). The
            results showed that MBAT participants learned new, specific ways of managing stress
            proactively, while experiencing mind and body connection, and gaining a sense of mastery
            and accomplishment. Participants in the NCT group also expressed that they were able
            to relax, work through their stressors, and create new self-care habits, but the effects
            of their clay use were described as more short-term, and they desired more guidance
            managing stressors. These results possibly indicate that MBAT could be effective for
            college students wanting techniques for lasting stress reduction and anxiety relief.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Ocean modeling, in a climate-modeling context, requires long time-horizons over global
            scales, which when combined with accurate resolution in time and space makes simulations
            very time-consuming. While high-resolution ocean-modeling simulations are still feasible
            on large HPC machines, performing uncertainty quantification or other many query applications
            at these resolutions is no longer feasible. Developing a more efficient model would
            allow for efficient uncertainty quantification, data assimilation, and spinup initializations.
            For these techniques to be feasible in practice, a faster model must be designed which
            can still attain sufficient accuracy. Techniques such as reduced order modeling produce
            an efficient reduced model based on existing high-resolution simulation data. Models
            produced by these techniques provide a tremendous speedup at the cost of reduced accuracy.
            To offset this trade-off, novel strategies are developed to retain as much accuracy
            as possible while still achieving tremendous speedups. Some of these methods improve
            accuracy by incorporating physical properties into the reduced model, leading to better
            solution quality. In this dissertation, a novel reduced order modeling method, the
            Hamiltonian-structure-preserving reduced order modeling method, will be derived and
            analyzed. The Hamiltonian structure is possessed by many physical systems and is directly
            related to energy conservation. This method produces a reduced model which retains
            the Hamiltonian structure of non-canonical Hamiltonian systems, which are the category
            of systems that many ocean models fall into. Error estimates are proven for the new
            method. The model is also be made to preserve linear invariants in the reduced model
            which are Casimirs. Casimirs are a class of special conserved quantities in the Hamiltonian
            Framework. For ocean-modeling, the Casimirs we consider are mass and potential vorticity.
            The new reduced model is proven to conserve both of these quantities. The model is
            also implemented in a special inner product derived from the Hamiltonian Framework,
            the approximate energy inner product. This special inner product not only improves
            the accuracy of the new method but also improves the accuracy of the traditional reduced
            order modeling method and leads to favorable analytical properties for problems with
            quadratic Hamiltonian functionals. The new method will be applied to the rotating
            shallow water equations, which act as a proxy to real ocean models, and compared to
            the traditional reduced order modeling method. Both energy conserving and forced test-cases
            are considered where energy conservation, accuracy, and stability are investigated.
            Special techniques are also implemented to ensure that the new method is as efficient
            as possible.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Repeated experiences are a cornerstone of learning and memory, but to what extent
            does the benefit of repetition depend upon noticing it? A rich literature exists examining
            the impact that an original learning experience has on a current experience when recognition
            of repeated material occurs while a surprisingly limited amount of research has examined
            the impact on relearning when recognition of repetition fails. Asch (1969) reported
            that recognition of repetition was necessary to experience a benefit of repeated experiences
            while the formal memory model Retrieving Effectively from Memory (REM; Shiffrin &amp;
            Steyvers, 1997), incorporating elements of Asch, assumes that an initial experience
            establishes a memory trace which is added to during a repetition, but only if the
            repetition accesses the original trace. If the repetition is not noticed, a second
            memory trace is created. I discuss research exploring the impact of recognition during
            a subsequent learning experience when the lists are separated by extreme context changes.
            In two experiments I attempted a conceptual replication of Asch and show that while
            recognition may not be necessary to receive a benefit of repeated information, there
            is a greater benefit during relearning when recognition of repetition occurs.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The diagnosis and treatment of gliomas continues to pose a significant challenge for
            oncologists who not only have to contend with managing acute neurological symptoms,
            but also the almost inevitable development of resistance to treatment. Indeed, the
            last 25 years have produced minimal advancements in treatment efficacy, even though
            significant efforts and resources have been invested in the quest for breakthroughs.
            This effort has not been restricted only to clinicians or oncologists, with mathematical
            modeling also playing an increasingly important role. A variety of models aimed at
            providing new insights into glioma growth and response to treatment have been proposed.
            Initially designed to capture fundamental behavior of tumor cells, such as growth
            and motility, these models quickly became well-established and multiple extensions
            have since been introduced. However, as increasing biological details of how tumor
            cells respond to treatment at cellular and subcellular levels are revealed, mathematical
            models need to include this state of the art knowledge. The work presented in this
            thesis seeks to do this by refocusing our attention back to the most fundamental question:
            why are gliomas fatal? Biologically, it is known that glioma lethality is driven by
            a fast growth that increases intracranial pressure resulting in lethal neurological
            damage, which current treatments fail to prevent due to tumor cell resistance to treatments
            such as chemotherapy. By creating mathematical models inspired by these key elements
            of glioma malignancy, the work presented here seeks to elucidate what drives resistance
            to chemotherapy and how to overcome or mitigate it, as well as how malignancy correlated
            with intracranial pressure dynamics. Thus, the work comprises two main parts: (1)
            in silico optimization of treatment strategies using chemotherapy coupled with novel
            cell-repair inhibitors currently in various stages of the clinical trial; and (2)
            a study of tumor-induced intracranial pressure and edema in gliomas of grade I-IV.
            A wide variety of mathematical modeling techniques are used, that incorporate biomechanical,
            biochemical, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics aspects, and include a level of
            detail hitherto unconsidered. The proposed models are validated and analyzed by employing
            a diverse set of mathematical tools that range from structural identifiability, parameter
            estimation, to global and local sensitivity analysis. As a result of this work, we
            propose a treatment strategy that showed a 30% improvement in patient survival time
            over conventional treatment when treating heterogeneous brain tumors in silico. Moreover,
            the second part of this work demonstrates how the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumor-induced
            intracranial pressure correlate with cancer grade, providing a better understanding
            of the mechanisms that underlie increased intracranial pressure onset. Both projects
            come together as a first step towards a better understanding of the poor survival
            rates of patients afflicted with gliomas. They raise new questions about what characterizes
            the malignancy of primary brain tumors and how clinicians can fight it. Continued
            modeling effort in these directions has the potential to make an impact in the field
            of brain cancer diagnostics and treatment.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>There is an emerging body of research on the leadership learning of college students,
            but studies that examine the influence of racial or ethnic identity are minimal. Studies
            on the leadership learning of Black students and, more specifically, Black men is
            even scarcer. This dissertation study used a narrative inquiry methodology to explore
            how the experiences of undergraduate Black men influenced their leader identity. The
            study was grounded in a conceptual framework called experiential culturally relevant
            leadership learning that incorporates aspects of the culturally relevant leadership
            learning model (Bertrand Jones, Guthrie, &amp; Osteen, 2016) and the experiential learning
            model (D. A. Kolb, 1984). An anti-deficit approach (Harper, 2012) was used to challenge
            the dominate narrative about Black men in college. The sample contained 15 undergraduate
            Black men from a predominantly White institution in the Southeastern United States.
            The findings suggest there are various formal and informal experiences that reinforce
            undergraduate Black men’s leader identity as well as experiences that enhance it.
            The study also brings to light numerous challenges to the experiences of Black men
            who are student leaders.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Various health conditions, and/or aging can result in the need for care assistance.
            The number of Americans who need care assistance has grown over the past several decades,
            with the amount expected to increase as the number of individuals entering older adulthood
            rises. Informal caregivers are those who assist others with medical or other personal
            tasks without pay. Due to the complex demands of caregiving, informal caregivers often
            report high levels of stress and decreases in psychosocial wellbeing, especially when
            compared to those who are not caregivers. Research has indicated the need for support
            interventions to address informal caregivers’ needs, yet the unique needs of this
            population have posed challenges in developing appropriate and accessible resources.
            The purpose of this dissertation was to investigate the effects of a single music
            therapy session utilizing a music-assisted mindfulness relaxation intervention with
            psychoeducation session and electronic resource on psychosocial wellbeing of informal
            caregivers of adults with chronic health needs. Intervention data collection sessions
            were conducted at an adult day facility, community wellness clinic, and community
            church sites, and were led by a board-certified music therapist. The intervention
            facilitated was a music-assisted relaxation exercise utilizing research-supported
            live guitar accompaniment, guided breathing prompts, imagery, and a spoken mindfulness
            loving-kindness meditation. Following the music-assisted mindfulness relaxation (MAMR),
            a psychoeducation discussion was facilitated to educate participants about the techniques
            experienced and provide strategies for incorporating into daily life practices. Participants
            were given an electronic recording of the same MAMR done in the intervention session
            and prompted to use the resource in their preferred manner over a two-week time period.
            Participants, who were adults aged 62-89 and provided assistance to an individual
            over the age of 50 for at least five hours per week, for at least the past three months.
            Perceived stress and wellbeing were measured along with participants’ perception of
            the MAMR intervention and MAMR electronic resource. Perceived stress was measured
            using a researcher created tool (Likert-type scale) and wellbeing was measured using
            the WHO (Five) Wellbeing Index (1998 version). Subjects completed the perceived stress
            score before and following the intervention. The WHO wellbeing index was completed
            by participants prior to the intervention and two-weeks post session. Results indicated
            there was a significant difference between perceived stress scores prior to and following
            the MAMR intervention. Further analysis of perceived stress difference score indicated
            no difference between those who lived with the care receiver and those who did not.
            However, results did indicate a significant difference between those who engaged a
            minimum to moderate level and those who engaged at a maximum level in caregiving duties.
            Results of WHO wellbeing analysis also indicated a significant difference between
            scores from pre intervention to two-weeks post intervention. Further analysis indicated
            there was not a significant difference in WHO wellbeing difference scores between
            those who used the intervention one time or not at all, and those who used the intervention
            two times or more. No significant difference was found between those who lived with
            care receiver and those who did not, and those with minimum to moderate caregiving
            levels and those with maximum caregiving levels and WHO wellbeing difference scores.
            Participants’ perception of the intervention indicated the use of several techniques
            when facilitating a similar music-assisted relaxation with informal caregivers in
            clinical music therapy practice. The outcomes of this study warrant the need for future
            research to determine effective ways to use this intervention with the informal caregiving
            population.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The hexokinase (HK) family of enzymes catalyze the conversion of glucose to glucose
            6-phosphate in a process that is utilized for energy production in most organisms.
            Hexokinase IV, commonly known as glucokinase (GCK), is functionally distinct from
            the rest of the HK isozymes. It is characterized by a high substrate concentration
            at half-maximal velocity and is not inhibited by an abundance of its product. GCK
            also displays positive kinetic cooperativity, despite functioning as a monomer and
            containing only one glucose binding site. This responsiveness is such that the inflection
            point occurs in the range of physiological blood glucose levels, providing the enzyme
            with exceptional sensitivity in this region. GCK’s unique functional properties allow
            it to control the rates of insulin release and glycogen synthesis. The significance
            of proper GCK function is emphasized by various pathological conditions that arise
            from mutations in the gck gene. These discoveries are expanded upon in Chapter 1 and
            have led to GCK being considered the glucose sensor of the body. Millisecond timescale
            fluctuations of the small domain have been shown to be essential for cooperativity
            in GCK. However, a detailed picture of GCK’s dynamic conformational landscape, including
            the number of accessible states, their relative populations, and the timescales on
            which they interconvert is absent in the literature. In Chapter 2, we map the intrinsic
            dynamics and structural heterogeneity of GCK on the nanosecond timescale using a combination
            of unnatural amino acid incorporation, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and
            19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Based on these results, we propose a
            catalytic model in which cooperativity originates from correlation between nanosecond
            and millisecond timescale motions. Activating GCK mutations abolish cooperativity
            and manifest themselves in the clinic as congenital hyperinsulinism. In Chapter 3,
            we use steady- and transient-state kinetics, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass
            spectrometry, to demonstrate that mutational activation of GCK occurs via two distinct
            mechanisms: α and β. Our data reveal that α-activation results from a shift in the
            conformational ensemble of unliganded GCK toward a state resembling the glucose-bound,
            closed conformation. β-type activation is instead caused by increased mobile loop
            dynamics, which accelerate the product release rate. This work elucidates the molecular
            basis of naturally occurring, activated GCK disease variants. Due to its essential
            role in maintaining whole-body glucose homeostasis, GCK activity is extensively regulated
            at virtually every level in the cell. The hormonal, metabolic, and transcriptional
            regulation of GCK have been described in great detail by other laboratories.1,2 Protein-protein
            interactions and post-translational modifications involving GCK elicit an array of
            physiological consequences and intrinsic conformational dynamics provide GCK with
            an additional layer of functional control. In Chapter 4, we offer insights into how
            these regulatory strategies are integrated and coordinated within the broader context
            of the cell. Of these regulatory mechanisms, the post-translational conjugation of
            the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO1) protein to GCK remains one of the most poorly
            understood. Recently, it was reported that SUMOylation increases GCK’s activity and
            stability, and mediates nuclear translocation of the enzyme.3,4 However, the inability
            to isolate homogenous, SUMOylated proteins often inhibits full characterization of
            the modification. In Chapter 5 we describe our efforts to generate SUMOylated GCK
            using semi-synthetic and coexpression approaches. We conclude with a look to the future,
            emphasizing the need for continued investigation and describing future experiments.
            In Chapter 6, we deviate from investigations of GCK and describe our efforts to characterize
            CyrI, a unique iron-dependent, nonheme oxygenase. This enzyme is expressed in cyanobacteria,
            where it catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of the toxic drinking water
            contaminant cylindrospermopsin. CyrI catalyzes a challenging C-H oxidation step with
            exquisite selectivity and appears to be depend on a sulfate group as a substrate recognition
            motif. CyrI is intriguing to develop from a chemical synthesis perspective as the
            selective functionalization of C-H bonds among numerous similarly reactive C-H bonds
            is a considerable challenge in organic synthesis. We detail our analysis of CyrI stability
            and crystallization and provide insights into future experimentation.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The official nosology of psychiatric disorders (DSM-5) includes a primarily dimensional
            operationalization of personality pathology, the Alternative Model for Personality
            Disorders (AMPD), in its latest edition. The present study examines the impact of
            DSM-5 AMPD Criterion B personality traits on clinical outcomes in a sample of 185
            outpatients seeking treatment at a University-based community psychology clinic. AMPD
            personality traits Disinhibition and Antagonism predicted an increase in missed sessions
            over the course of therapy, as did dimensionally-assessed borderline PD, antisocial
            PD, and narcissistic PD. Trait Detachment had a quadratic relationship with premature
            termination, where individuals in the high and low range of the Detachment distribution
            had increased risk of premature termination compared with individuals with moderate
            levels of Detachment. As in previous research, AMPD personality traits successfully
            predicted which individuals were diagnosed with borderline personality disorder via
            standard diagnostic criteria. The current study’s findings demonstrate that DSM-5
            personality traits can be used to identify individuals at increased risk for missed
            sessions and premature termination and provide a way forward for clinicians to begin
            incorporating dimensional personality assessment in clinical practice.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>High refractive index polymer has always been one of the great interests for their
            potential in industrial applications. One of the important methods in achieving this
            goal is to create high cross-linking density network. Though thiol-ene reaction, multi-vinyl
            monomer and multi-ene monomer joint covalently to form a dense network structure.
            This dissertation discusses a fundamental way to develop high refractive index polymer
            through thiol-ebe polymerization. In the first part of this dissertation, multi-vinyl
            monomers and multi-thiol monomers were synthesized and mixed to make polymers using
            thermal initiation. Structural characterizations were performed using infrared and
            NMR. Thermal characterizations were performed using DSC, TGA and DMA. Optical properties
            like refractive indices and transmission were also measured. The results indicate
            that among all the phosphine polymers, PVSe-BDTH has the highest refractive index
            and it is among the highest refractive index organic polymer could achieve. It also
            has high storage modulus of several GPa. In addition to PVSe-BDTH, PVSe-EDTH is another
            good candidate though the introduction of EDTH made the material slightly softer.
            The second part of this dissertation discusses the effects of the introduction of
            several synthesized additives. An increasing weight percent of additives were added
            to the in the formation of PMMA polymer and their effects on refractive indices were
            examined. The third part of this dissertation discusses the positive influence of
            the introduction of computational method upon guiding the development of our materials.
            The refractive indices and densities of the previously synthesized monomers and polymers
            were calculated and compared with the experimental values and proved to be effective.
            Then the method was applied to several of our potential monomer and polymer targets,
            by comparing their relative refractive indices the compounds with better anticipated
            properties were synthesized. The experimental measurements indicate that our combination
            of method and basis set provide rather accurate prediction on both frequency-dependent
            polarizabilities and molecular volumes, therefore providing refractive indices and
            densities that fit our expectations. In addition to these, the calculation method
            can also predict IR and NMR peaks and provide possible explanation to unknown peaks.
            Overall, it is a useful tool in our studies in the early stages of product design
            and property predictions.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Feature selection is an important technique for high dimensional statistics and machine
            learning. It has many applications in computer vision, natural language processing,
            bioinformatics, etc. However, most of the feature selection methods in the literature
            are proposed for offline learning while the existing online feature selection methods
            have limitations in true feature recovery. In this dissertation, we propose some novel
            online feature selection methods and a framework. One is called Stochastic Feature
            Selection with Annealing, and the other one is the framework of running averages.
            Based on the methods and the framework we developed, we can recover the support of
            the true features with higher accuracy. We provide a theoretical analysis, and through
            simulations and experiments on real sparse datasets, we show that our proposed methods
            compare favorably with some state-of-the-art online methods in the literature.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Polyelectrolyte multilayer thin films have been used as coatings due to their biocompatibility
            for cell culture experiments. During layer-by-layer assembly of these multilayer thin
            films, the film is altered by adjusting the salt concentration, the rinsing time,
            and the temperature which changes the morphology of the film. Certain factors such
            as surface charge and the polymer effect the biocompatibility of the film and its
            ability to adsorb serum proteins. If cells adhere and proliferate on a film it is
            called ‘cytophilic’. Conversely, if cells do not adhere to a film or undergo apoptosis
            on the film, the surface is called ‘cytophobic’. Cell behavior was discussed in this
            dissertation for polyelectrolyte multilayers composed of the polycations; poly(diallyldimethylammonium),
            PDADMAC, and poly(allylammonium chloride), PAH, and polyanions; poly(4-styrenesulfonic
            acid), PSS, and poly(acrylic acid), PAA. The adhesion and proliferation of cells are
            dependent on the surface to which they attach. Aside from cell counting, cell “health”
            on surfaces is typically established by measuring the metabolic rate with dyes that
            participate in the metabolic pathway or using “live/dead” assays with combinations
            of membrane permeable/impermeable dyes. Whether cells are attached or not, and whether
            they are living or dead, provides an incomplete picture of cell health. In this dissertation,
            proliferation rates and net metabolism of 3T3 fibroblasts seeded on “biocompatible”
            ultrathin polyelectrolyte multilayer films and on control tissue culture plastic were
            compared. Cells adhered to, and proliferated on, both surfaces, which were shown to
            be nontoxic according to live/dead assays. However, adhesion was poorer on the multilayer
            surface, illustrated by diffuse organization of the actin cytoskeleton and less-developed
            focal adhesions. Proliferation was also slower on the multilayer. When normalized
            for the total number of cells, it was shown that cells on multilayers experienced
            a five-day burst of metabolic stress, after which the metabolic rate approached that
            of the control surface. This initial state of high stress had not been reported previously
            in studies of cell growth on multilayers, although the observation period for this
            system was usually a few days. The interaction of nanoparticles and surfaces with
            the complex array of proteins in physiological media is largely responsible for maintaining
            circulation in the bloodstream and biocompatibility in general. It is known that composition
            of the initial “soft” corona of exchangeable adsorbed proteins evolves to comprise
            a more tenaciously held “hard” corona. In this dissertation, the dependence of cell
            adhesion on a thin film of polyelectrolyte complex is connected to the “hardness”
            of the initial corona using albumin, the most prevalent protein in serum. The ease
            with which albumin can be displaced depended on the surface functional group - carboxylate
            or sulfonate, in particular aromatic sulfonate. Carboxylate permitted easier exchange
            of albumin, which presumably allowed the adsorption of proteins such as fibronectin,
            required for cell adhesion. Sulfonate held on to albumin more strongly, producing
            a persistent hard corona likely to remain biocompatible. The mechanism is thought
            to be related to the higher energy of interaction between sulfonate and amine than
            between carboxylate and amine.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation consists of three individual studies on the role of state governments
            in social welfare. The first paper discusses the relationship between gubernatorial
            administrative capacity and the ability for Democrats to increase social welfare spending
            after the state has experienced an economic downturn. Using panel data for 49 US states
            from 1987 to 2014, I examine whether budgetary authority allows governors to respond
            to an economic contraction in the expected partisan matter. I find evidence to support
            the view that governors shape budget policy in a manner that is consistent with their
            preferences. The second paper is on the decentralization of Medicaid and Aid to Families
            with Dependent Children (AFDC)/Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) by the
            national government to the state governments to see if the programs were made worse
            off in performing their goal of poverty alleviation. Decentralization is measured
            using expenditure ratios of state general fund spending to federal government spending.
            I find that more state involvement in Medicaid reduces expected poverty growth even
            after controlling for state economic, political, and demographic factors. Although
            no effect was found from AFDC/TANF decentralization, the results do demonstrate a
            positive impact from more state involvement in Medicaid. The final study is on the
            impact of social assistance programs on infant health. Infant mortality rates are
            an important indicator of population health. The primary goal of this chapter is to
            serve as an evaluation of government redistributive programs and population health.
            Do the outputs of social assistance programs reach their intended beneficiaries? I
            find that increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and TANF benefit
            generosity within states has a negative association with overall infant mortality
            after controlling for economic development and additional factors related to infant
            health.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Social behaviors are foundational to our society and quality of life while social
            behavioral deficits are core symptoms in a variety of psychopathologies. Yet, despite
            the significance for human health, the neural mechanisms that regulate social behavior
            are incompletely characterized. Oxytocin (OXT) is a neuro-active hormone that has
            been well-studied over the last several decades and shown to regulate social behaviors.
            The OXT system interacts with early life environment and an individual’s genotype
            to regulate social behaviors in a sexually dimorphic manner. Chapter 1 describes background
            information on the role of OXT in social behaviors. Thereafter, research on the developmental
            role of OXT is discussed. Chapter 1 ends with the proposal of a novel mechanism by
            which socially acquired OXT may regulate social behaviors. In chapters 2-5, experiments
            are described which aim to empirically test this central hypothesis. In chapter 2,
            a functional role for oxytocin receptors (OXTR) in the oronasal cavity were investigated
            in developing mice as a potential mechanism by which OXT can interact with early life
            sensory experience to regulate brain activity and behavior. OXTRs have recently been
            characterized in the periphery of developing mice that appear to be located on sensory
            apparatuses. We tested the effects of orally applied OXT, compared to saline, on a
            marker of neural activation, c-Fos, in sensory processing brain regions and the paraventricular
            nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). To test the effects of orally applied OXT on sensory-dependent
            brain activity, we also brushed the whiskers of mice after OXT or saline treatment
            in a separate experiment. Orally administered OXT, compared to saline, increased c-Fos
            in the PVN, and decreased c-Fos activity in sensory processing brain regions after
            whisker brushing. Additionally, orally applied OXT, compared to saline, with whisker
            brushing decreased Fos in the trigeminal motor nucleus as well as oral-motor behavior
            of females. Compared to saline, oral OXT with whisker brushing also increased males
            long distance locomotor behavior. These data support the possibility of a functional
            role for OXT acting on oronasal OXTR to modulate the brain and behavior in developing
            mice. In chapter 3, the idea of OXT exchange between conspecifics as a potential driver
            of social behaviors was tested by examining the preference of male and female mice
            towards OXT containing social stimuli. Male and female mice showed a preference to
            investigate same-sex mice that contained OXT versus OXT knock-out (KO) mice. Next,
            we tested if mice prefer OXT KO bedding containing OXT versus saline and found that
            males prefer female OXT KO bedding with OXT compared to saline. Finally, we tested
            the role of OXTR in sensory ganglia in the social preference of live mice by using
            transgenic mice breeding strategies to selectively knock out OXTR in sensory ganglia.
            We found that female mice lacking sensory OXTR (OXTRsensory KO) had reduced social
            investigation levels compared to their wild-type (OXTRsensory WT) litter mates. The
            role of OXTR in sensory ganglia in social behaviors was further tested in chapter
            4 by examining sociability, preference for social novelty, and aggression in OXTRsensory
            WT and KO mice. OXTRsensory KO females had reduced approach behaviors during the sociability
            test, compared to OXTRsensory WT females. Altogether, data from chapters 2-4 indicate
            that environmentally acquired OXT can regulate brain activity and influence behaviors.
            In addition, mice preferred other mice that contain OXT over OXT KO mice, but not
            same-sex OXT KO bedding with OXT over saline. These data suggest that preference for
            an OXT containing live same-sex conspecific may be due to an interaction between OXT
            and social sensory signals rather than OXT alone. Lastly, these data indicate that
            OXTRs in sensory ganglia are an important regulator of social behaviors, particularly
            for females. Finally, in chapter 5, we aimed to explore the translational significance
            of these findings by examining if variation in the OXTR gene is associated with variation
            in social sensory processing in humans, with significance for trait meanness. We genotyped
            the common OXTR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1042778 and rs53576 in male
            and female participants that had brain event related potentials (ERP) recorded in
            response to viewing affective faces. We found that females homozygous for the OXTR
            SNP rs1042778 G allele had enhanced fear-specific brain responses compared to T allele
            carriers. Additionally, the rs53576 A allele was associated with higher ERP amplitudes
            to face stimuli, but not scrambled faces, compared to GG allele carriers. Further,
            OXTR SNPs rs1042778 and rs53576 interacted to predict trait meanness in females. These
            data implicate OXTR gene variability in the etiology of sensory processing variation
            in the brain as well as trait meanness. A summary of results as well as implications
            and suggestions for future research are discussed in chapter 6.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This study will examine St. John’s II period subsistence practices along the St. John’s
            River through faunal analysis of archaeological material from the Shields Mound site
            (8DU12). Shields Mound, and the nearby Grant Mound, were originally excavated by C.B.
            Moore in 1893. His excavations focused on describing the appearance and features of
            the mounds, as well as, providing a detailed description of the stratigraphic changes
            encountered during excavation of the main mound and the artifacts that were discovered.
            Between 1999 and 2002, Keith Ashley, revisited the site to gain a better understanding
            of the village area associated with the mounds, as this was not a focus of Moore’s
            excavation. Ashley (2005) determined the mounds were representative of the St. John’s
            II period (A.D. 900-1250). His research focused on introducing the Mill Cove Complex
            within which Shields Mound is located and developing an understanding of the site
            in general. A 2005 issue of The Florida Anthropologist was dedicated to findings from
            the Mill Cove Complex. Marrinan (2005) completed faunal analysis from three distinct
            shell midden locations of the site: Kinsey’s Knoll, Bluff Midden, and Reeve’s Rise.
            Rolland (2005) additionally analyzed the ceramics that were discovered during excavations
            to determine what types were most prominent in the assemblages. Penders (2005) contributed
            to the understanding of the site through an analysis of bone, antler, tooth, and shell
            artifacts from the features that were excavated. Since 2005, Ashley and students have
            returned to the Shields Mound area and excavated additional samples. A primary goal
            of this study, therefore, is to utilize the information from these studies, as well
            as additional research, to determine if ritual activity, specifically feasting activity,
            was occurring at Shields Mound. I will utilize data from additional locations in the
            vicinity of Shields Mound and compare these data with criteria proposed by Jackson
            and Scott (1995) on feasting at an inland site. I will also consider any additional
            evidence, such as quantity and size of ceramic vessels, quantity of artifacts discovered,
            and the role of prestige or high-status species diversification, in my analysis to
            determine if ritual activity was occurring at Shields.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Traumatic head injury is associated with an array of antisocial behavior. Furthermore,
            head injury is associated with many of the antisocial risk factors identified in the
            criminological literature. To date, no research has attempted to incorporate measures
            of head injury into existing criminological theories. The aim of this study is to
            investigate the connection between head injury and antisocial behavior by attempting
            to incorporate head injury into four of the most popular criminological theories.
            This is done by examining the interaction effects between head injury and the various
            constructs that make up social learning theory, general strain theory, social bond
            theory, and the general theory of crime. Several of key findings are discussed, and
            suggestions for future research and theoretical development are considered.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Up to 37% of United States adults experience psychological distress at clinically
            high levels; however, the majority of them do not seek psychological help. Reluctance
            to seek help is exacerbated in rural culture, as rural people are less likely to seek
            psychological help than urban people. A review of the literature revealed that one
            highly prevalent rural factor that may affect help-seeking is perceived stigma. Rural
            emphasis on self-reliance and religiosity, limited knowledge of mental illness, and
            confidentiality concerns are all stigma-related variables that have been shown to
            influence rural people’s decision to seek help. Prior to the current study, the influence
            of perceived stigma in the link between psychological distress and willingness to
            seek psychological help had not been examined specifically among rural people. Further,
            many of the existing studies on stigma-related factors examined one factor at a time
            and are of qualitative nature. Within a rural-only sample, the current study examined
            the moderating effect of perceived stigma between psychological distress and willingness
            to seek psychological help. Also, this study examined the predictive abilities of
            self-reliance, religiosity, confidentiality concerns, and knowledge of mental illness
            when predicting perceived stigma and willingness to seek psychological help. Findings
            of this study suggest that knowledge of mental disorders is most influential on rural
            willingness to seek psychological help – more so than self-reliance, confidentiality
            concerns, and religiosity. Further, confidentiality concerns emerged as most impactful
            on perceived stigma among rural adults – more so than knowledge of mental disorders,
            self-reliance, and religiosity. Greater knowledge was associated with more help-seeking
            willingness, and greater confidentiality concerns were associated with more perceived
            stigma. However, perceived stigma was not significantly related to willingness to
            seek psychological help, nor did it moderate the relation between psychological distress
            and willingness to seek psychological help. Interestingly, greater psychological distress
            experienced by rural people was associated with less willingness to seek psychological
            help, suggesting a reverse relation between distress and help-seeking than that found
            in the general population. Clinical consideration of study findings may help combat
            the unique challenges associated with help-seeking in rural communities – challenges
            viewed by some mental health professionals as unsolvable or hopeless. As knowledge
            of mental disorders and confidentiality concerns emerged as the most important factors
            in willingness to seek psychological help and perceived stigma, respectively, interventions
            aimed to target these two factors may improve acceptability and utilization of rural
            mental healthcare. Integration of mental health education into primary care and community
            outreach partnerships (with churches, organizations, etc.) may positively influence
            rural adults’ willingness to seek psychological help. Further, discussing manners
            of maintaining confidentiality during the aforementioned educational interventions
            may help ease perceived stigma toward mental illness among rural residents. As mental
            health providers can work to improve mental health literacy and confidentiality concerns,
            findings of this study suggest that rural mental health challenges may not be as “unsolvable”
            as previously believed.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This study examined the quantity and quality of language interactions between young
            Spanish-English speaking children and their caregivers during book sharing in two
            conditions: with and without feedback on quantity of adult language input. The intervention
            used a wearable word-counter that provided synchronous visual displays on a smartphone
            application. Interactions were identified and transcribed from day-long LENA recordings.
            Descriptive analysis compared caregiver language in book sharing, before and during
            a language intervention intended to increase caregivers’ awareness of the quantity
            of language delivered to their children. An increase in quantity and quality of language
            was anticipated due to the addition of feedback on adult language interactions, however
            results indicated inconsistency in the increase of quantity and quality of language.
            From this study clinicians, teachers, and families can observe how a self-monitored
            quantitative language intervention does not independently impact quantity and quality
            of caregiver’s language during book sharing.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Educators use various statistical techniques to explain relationships between latent
            and observable variables. One way to model these relationships is to use Bayesian
            networks as a scoring model. However, adjusting the conditional probability tables
            (CPT-parameters) to fit a set of observations is still a challenge when using Bayesian
            networks. A CPT provides the conditional probabilities of a single discrete variable
            with respect to other discrete variables. In general Bayesian networks, the CPTs that
            link the proficiency variable and observable outcomes are not necessarily monotonic,
            but they are often constrained to be monotonic in educational applications. The monotonicity
            constraint states that if an examinee shows an improvement on a proficiency variable
            (parent variable), the individual performance on an observable (child variable) should
            improve. For example, if a student has a higher writing skill, then this student is
            likely to score better on an essay task. For educational research, building parametric
            models (i.e., DiBello models) with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm provides
            monotonic conditional probability tables (CPT). This dissertation explored the effectiveness
            of the EM algorithm within the DiBello parameterization under different sample sizes,
            test forms, and item structures. The data generation model specifies two skill variables
            with a different number of items depending on the test forms. The outcome measures
            were the relative bias of the parameters to assess parameter recovery, Kullback-Leibler
            distance to evaluate the distance between CPTs, and Cohen’s κ to assess classification
            agreement between data generation and estimation models. The simulation study results
            showed that a minimum sample size of 400 was sufficient to produce acceptable parameter
            bias and KL distance. A balanced distribution of simple and integrated type items
            produced less bias compared to an unbalanced item distribution. The parameterized
            EM algorithm stabilized the estimates for cells small sizes in CPTs, providing minimal
            KL distance values. However, the classification agreement between generated and estimated
            models was low.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Critical examinations of the simulacrum have frozen, due in part to the overabundance
            and simplified applications of Jean Baudrillard’s canonical theories. In a 2003 book
            review, David Banash voices this frustration, identifying “surprisingly little nuance”
            in the handling of “Baudrillard’s theory of simulation.” He faults critics and scholars
            who generally “treat [Baudrillard’s] work as if it were an objective description of
            the world,” as if “somehow DeLillo offers a kind of proof for Baudrillard.” We can
            note a similar dynamic at play in criticisms that evaluate postmodern literature according
            to Fredric Jameson’s definition of the postmodern condition, or the “cultural logic
            of late capitalism.” He too distinguishes postmodern aesthetics as reducing historical,
            critical, ethical work into “pseudo-events.” Though aligned with two different theoretical
            “schools,” both Baudrillard and Jameson offer a “nihilistic” account of postmodernism.
            In “apocalyptic” gestures, they situate the opportunity for genuine subversive art
            in the past, marking postmodern aesthetics as the end of all critical productivity.
            In this dissertation, however, I argue that postmodern authors and filmmakers employ
            the simulacrum for a purpose that till now has gone overlooked by the critical trend
            that prioritizes these theories and approaches. Through close readings and historical
            accounts of key texts from Thomas Pynchon, Don DeLillo, Toni Morrison, and David Lynch,
            I demonstrate how simulacral imagery also works to raise our awareness of the constructed
            nature of authenticity. Employed in this alternative function, the simulacrum does
            not contribute to the total evacuation of meaning. Rather, it both installs and subverts
            traditional “realist” methods of representation. The simulacral imagery in these works
            tempt us to read them according to traditional, rational reading practices, which
            would lead us to assign authenticity to representations based on preexisting cultural
            convention. Yet, by simultaneously undermining the authority of those conventions,
            these simulacra reveal how authenticity exists as a cultural value, a device laden
            with political significance and derived from the combination of various aesthetic
            elements. In this more recalcitrant way, the simulacrum resists and denaturalizes
            the conventions for representation that encourage dominant systems of power. I title
            these the “hallucinatory simulacrum” in order to underscore this imagery as contrary
            to traditional veridical modes of representation.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In teaching leadership and leader identity development to Latina undergraduate women,
            it is imperative their salient identities are addressed and acknowledged. The teaching
            of standardized forms of leadership and the deconstruction of established leadership
            principles and paradigms also need to be taken into consideration. Leadership educators
            need to create spaces in which Latina undergraduate students can thrive in classroom
            environments, student organizations, and programs. Because leadership is understood
            through an American cultural lens, reflection and meaning-making should be encouraged
            to integrate identity and culture within the realm of leader identity development.
            Through these experiences, the Latina leader identity development can be further reinforced.
            This study explored the leader identity development of Latina undergraduate women
            via testimonio as methodology (Huber, 2009; Reyes &amp; Rodríguez, 2012). The culturally
            relevant leadership learning model (CRLL) (Bertrand Jones, Guthrie, &amp; Osteen, 2016)
            and the women’s leader identity development model (WLID) (Le Ber, LaValley, Devnew,
            Berghout Austin, Elbert, Sulpizio, &amp; Tremaine, 2017) were used as conceptual frameworks.
            A sample of 12 self-identified Latina undergraduate women who were also involved in
            a student organization in any capacity and/or had taken a leadership class participated
            in the study. Participants were asked to write a testimonio regarding their leadership
            journey in college, and a follow up interview took place discussing their testimonio
            and their leader identity development. Based on the themes that emerged in the study,
            Latina undergraduate women developed their leader identity through leadership experiences,
            leadership courses, and various involvements on campuses. Participants indicated the
            importance of a culturally relevant campus climate and support from faculty, staff,
            and peers in their leader identity development. Aspects of the CRLL and WLID models
            were applicable to their experiences, and participants were able to provide recommendations
            to faculty and staff on how to help Latina undergraduate women develop their leader
            identity in college.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation defends the position that vagueness is semantic – a feature of language
            and thought alone. In order to do so, I argue that vagueness is genuine; that it cannot
            be reduced to ignorance. I then refute three arguments that semantic vagueness, if
            genuine, must extend to features of the world that are not representations. Lastly,
            I argue that, although we might take representations to be examples of a type of metaphysical
            vagueness, semantic vagueness, even if in some sense metaphysical, does not suffer
            from the pernicious aspects attributable to other forms of metaphysical vagueness.
            I argue that epistemicism is troubled by fine-grained phenomenal sorites series in
            which adjacent objects are indistinguishable. To avoid contradiction the epistemicist
            must say either that adjacent objects in the series do not appear the same as their
            neighbors or that an undetectable difference in appearance makes a psychological difference
            to how the objects appear. Both options are implausible. The supervaluationist is
            more easily able to resolve the difficulty by appealing to extant fundamental aspects
            of her theory. Next, I discuss a dilemma Ken Akiba (2004) presses against supervaluationism
            based on the nature of reference. He argues that reference is either deflationary
            or inflationary, but if deflationism is true then there cannot be semantic vagueness
            because there is no substantive reference. I argue that this is false – reference
            need not be substantive to be imprecise. The second horn claims that if inflationism
            is true then reference is constituted by indeterminate physical connections so an
            inflationary supervaluationist must already accept physical indeterminateness. I argue
            that this is also false – an inflationary supervaluationist can, for principled reasons,
            constrain the indeterminateness at issue in the semantic domain. Neither horn of Akiba’s
            dilemma is sharp. Many theorists of vagueness hold that vagueness is mind-dependent,
            that vagueness is due either to imprecise representation of a precise world or ignorance
            of representational (and worldly) precision. Recently Trenton Merricks (2001 and 2017)
            has launched two offensives against this cluster of views that he dubs the orthodoxy.
            He argues that (2001) if there is linguistic vagueness it is either epistemic or a
            species of metaphysical vagueness and that (2017) there are mind-independent examples
            of vagueness – vagueness that is due neither to representational imprecision or ignorance.
            This chapter defends the orthodoxy from Merricks’ arguments. I contend that his (2001)
            argument conflates garden-variety ambiguity with vagueness, and so can be met by the
            standard supervaluationist approach to vagueness, and that his (2017) argument relies
            on the claim that for every predicate there is a corresponding property, which is
            both implausible and will already be rejected by those who believe that vagueness
            is mind-dependent. Finally, I argue that two concerns facing metaphysical vagueness,
            that of it’s alleged unintelligibility and that it objectionably entails indeterminate
            identity, can be mollified for representational theories of vagueness that count representations
            as metaphysical entities.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>A comprehensive rainfall-based index of the Australian monsoon is created. This index
            is based on methodology previously used on the Indian subcontinent for determining
            the seasonality of the Indian monsoon. In order to create the Australian monsoon index,
            only rainfall data is used, which even over the sparsely populated areas of northern
            Australia is available dating back over 100 years (to 1901). The methodology for calculating
            the Australian monsoon index has been shown to be robust and not susceptible to false
            onsets. The Australian monsoon index objectively captures the onset date, the demise
            date, and the total seasonal rainfall for each monsoon season. This new index was
            then compared to various atmospheric dynamic and thermodynamic variables to see if
            the index was reflective of the broader seasonal atmospheric changes associated with
            the monsoon. The Australian monsoon index introduced in this study is found to be
            consistent with the meridional advancement of the precipitable water south of the
            equator and over the Australian land mass as the monsoon season begins. Atmospheric
            dynamics related to the low-level wind data shows a pronounced wind shift across the
            region corresponding to the onset and the demise of the monsoon based on the rainfall
            index. The examination of linear trends show that the length of the season has gotten
            longer and wetter, with earlier onsets and later demises since the beginning of the
            20th century. One final aspect of the monsoon that is investigated is the interannual
            variability of the monsoon and how the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) impacts
            the onset, demise, length of season, and total rainfall of the Australian monsoon.
            It is observed that warm or cold ENSO events are associated with shorter or longer
            Australian monsoon season, respectively. Similarly, these warm or cold ENSO events
            are associated with drier or wetter seasonal rainfall anomalies of the Australian
            monsoon, respectively.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Older United States (U.S.) veterans are a population at risk for disability due to
            their early life experiences with military service and increasing age. Military service
            was a normative part of early adult life for today’s older U.S. population, bringing
            the number of veterans aged 60 and older in 2015 to over 9.3 million. Despite older
            veterans’ lived experience, substantial population size, and potential impact on the
            U.S. health care system, the details of their later-life disability experience are
            not well understood. The following project uses the nationally representative, longitudinal
            Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to examine the role of veteran status on the disablement
            process of veterans compared to nonveterans over a decade (2004-2014), including an
            exploration of the underlying life course mechanisms influencing disablement, with
            the goal of providing a recent look at the long-term physical health consequences
            of military service. Chapter 3 establishes the occurrence of an observable veteran
            health paradox among HRS respondents 60 years and older. I unpack the components of
            the disablement process of veterans compared to nonveterans by creating separate baseline
            10-year trajectories for number of chronic conditions, disability, and mortality,
            including veteran status, age, race, and father’s education in the model. Three different
            disability trajectories were measured to capture the gradual progression and severity
            of disability: functional limitations (FLs), instrumental activities of daily living
            (IADLs), and activities of daily living (ADLs) which are considered the most severe
            manifestation of disability. The trajectories depict counterintuitive results: veterans
            have more chronic conditions but less self-reported FLs, IADLs, and ADLs compared
            to nonveterans. This finding stands in contrast to the progression of disablement
            described by Verbrugge and colleagues in the aging and disability literature. Veterans
            in this sample are also observed to experience a marginally lower risk of mortality
            at baseline but a significantly greater increasing risk of mortality over time compared
            to nonveterans, such that veterans have a survival deficit over the majority of the
            analytic period. The results of more chronic conditions, lower disability, and higher
            mortality suggest that veterans may die from diseases rather than becoming disabled.
            These findings are counterintuitive to the traditional disablement process and strongly
            suggest a veteran health paradox. Chronic conditions appear to play a crucial role
            within the disablement process of veterans, and they may hold answers to their overall
            disablement experience, so they are further tested in Chapter 4. Chapter 4 uses the
            same analytic sample from Chapter 3 to conduct a closer examination of chronic conditions
            and their role in the observed veteran health paradox. An interaction term for number
            of chronic conditions and veteran status (chronic conditions * veteran status) along
            with sociodemographic predictors and life course pathways are added to the trajectory
            models, which are also run separately with dichotomous variables of seven specific
            chronic conditions (arthritis, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, lung
            disease, and stroke) and their corresponding interaction with veteran status (specific
            chronic condition * veteran status). The findings suggest that veterans have less
            disability despite having more chronic conditions than nonveterans. Veterans, specifically
            those who self-reported having chronic conditions, seem to have an initial advantage
            in mortality that diminishes to meet the level of mortality for nonveterans by the
            end of the analytic period. Further inspection of chronic conditions and life course
            mechanisms suggest the interaction between veteran status and chronic conditions is
            driving the effects, with arthritis, diabetes, and heart disease standing out as significant
            in translating to lower disability (i.e. functional limitations) for veterans compared
            to their nonveteran counterparts. Exploration of covariates and life course pathways
            establish socioeconomic status, marriage, and health care access as independently
            protective mechanisms by which veterans fare better in the disablement process than
            nonveterans. These findings support the existence of an observed veteran health paradox
            within the sample and further highlight that the early stages of the disablement process
            play a key role in disability outcomes for veterans compared to nonveterans. The evidence
            for the veteran health paradox is new to the aging literature and reinforces the notion
            that veteran status is still a hidden variable with complex associations that may
            substantially alter results of population-level studies of health and disability processes.
            Acknowledgement of the nuanced disablement process of veterans is important for targeting
            prevention of chronic disease and disability, reduction of healthcare costs, and planning
            for the future of veteran-specific and population-level disability. This study is
            intended to make improvements in the overall health equity of U.S. veterans by informing
            researchers and policy-makers of their paradoxical disablement process and the importance
            of early stages of disablement to their later-life disability outcomes. Of note, the
            results highlight the need to tailor the chronic condition and disability management
            of older adults to their unique early-life experiences and the potential for early
            intervention to mitigate the onset of disability in later life. Further research is
            needed to deepen our understanding of the unique disablement process of veterans compared
            to nonveterans. Mechanisms stemming from specific service-related experiences—combat,
            environmental hazards, duration of service (career veterans vs. non-career veterans)—should
            be explored when possible. Differential onset of disability and differential health
            care access and utilization of veterans compared to nonveterans should also be explored
            as potential mechanisms for the observed veteran health paradox. All future research
            should strive for the use of nationally representative, longitudinal samples that
            include a marker for veteran status, and should use prospective veteran cohorts to
            document how younger veteran cohorts experience disablement and forecast how healthcare
            should adapt to their changing needs.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation consists of three essays examining the role of direct democracy
            in the American states. The papers broadly examine how actors in the direct democracy
            process decide to support ballot measures. Paper one is a panel experiment, conducted
            on the 2016 CCES. It explores what information matters to voters and when it matters
            in evaluating ballot measures. Paper two is an analysis of how newspapers cover ballot
            measures and how coverage influences voters. Paper three is an analysis of ballot
            measures and decentralization – exploring when and how decentralization influences
            citizen ballot measure support. Below I include brief abstracts of each. When and
            what types of informational cues do voters rely on when forming opinions? Previous
            tests on the influence of cues have used static, single time-frame designs and highlight
            the strength of partisan cues. In essay one, I make two contributions to that literature.
            It examines both partisan cues and policy information and does so over time. Using
            a panel experiment, I find that partisan cues trump policy cues when both are equally
            recent. However, policy information is capable of trumping party cues when policy
            information is more recent. These findings provide evidence that static experimental
            designs fail to capture the nuances of opinion formation that emerge from a more dynamic
            approach and that the type of cue leads to different effects at different times. Newspapers
            play a critical role in democracy–providing one of the few substantive and trustworthy
            sources of information for voters. Previous research has found that newspaper coverage
            of partisan elections is biased in the direction of the editorial board’s endorsement.
            I extend this research to ballot measures. Newspapers may engage in selection bias,
            dedicating more space to discussing one side of a ballot measure than alternative
            voting options, or presentation bias, presenting one side of a ballot measure campaign
            more favorably than alternative voting options. In essay two, I answer these questions:
            First, is newspaper coverage biased in ballot endorsement elections? Second, what
            types of bias do papers engage in? Finally, does the bias of newspaper coverage in
            ballot elections affect the outcome of ballot measure elections? I collect a sample
            of 36 initiative elections across five media markets to evaluate coverage. Using this
            data, I perform a content analysis examining how newspapers cover ballot initiative
            elections. I find that newspaper engage in both selection and presentation bias. Additionally,
            while the tone of coverage is not directly associated with support for initiative
            measures, positive press coverage does decrease the relative impact of a newspaper’s
            editorial endorsement. For decades, scholars of American and comparative federalism
            have found evidence of centralizing behavior in political institutions. The study
            of devolution has been relegated to specific policies (e.g. welfare reform) or dismissed
            as rhetorical bluster. In essay three, I argue that scholars of centralization have
            overlooked a potential institution of devolution – state ballot measures. I analyze
            a novel dataset of ballot measures in the U.S. states coded to reflect devolutionary
            impact. I find evidence that citizen-proposed ballot measures are decentralizing in
            nature and that centralization – regardless of proposing actor – is negatively associated
            with probability of passage.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The “Cliveden Set” was a 1930s, upper class group of prominent individuals who were
            politically influential in Britain during the interwar period. The group’s members
            included notable politicians, journalist, and aristocrats such as Nancy Astor, Geoffrey
            Dawson, Philip Kerr, Edward Wood, and Robert Brand. The term “Cliveden Set,” meant
            as a pejorative term, was coined by journalist Claud Cockburn who wrote for the newspaper
            The Week. Cockburn linked Geoffrey Dawson and The Times to a network led by the Astors
            who had an “extraordinary position of concentrated political power” and had become
            “one of the most important supports of German influence.” Considered to be a scapegoat
            for Britain’s Appeasement Policy by many historians, the Cliveden Set utilized their
            influence to encourage a British foreign policy that supported Hitler’s rearmament
            and the annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia. Their goal was to preserve British
            Imperial rule and promote the unification of the British dominions. Philip Kerr, Geoffrey
            Dawson, Robert Brand and Lionel Curtis had all been members of Milner’s Kindergarten
            in South Africa. Waldorf and Nancy Astor, who owned The Times and the Cliveden Estate,
            and others, sought to supplement formula for imperial unification that was demonstrated
            by Alfred Milner during South African reconstruction. By adopting this template of
            imperial preservation which was exercised by Milner’s Kindergarten, the Cliveden Set’s
            role in the developments that led to World War II became substantial..

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>In the United States, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women,
            except for skin cancers. The American Cancer Society estimates there will be 268,600
            new cases in 2019 alone. It is also the second leading cause of cancer mortality in
            U.S. women, after lung cancer, with an estimated 41,760 deaths set to occur in 2019.
            However, worldwide, breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women
            and the leading cause of female cancer deaths. There are many disparities in breast
            cancer incidence and prognosis. Among the starkest of these disparities is the difference
            between African American and Caucasian American women. African American women present
            with higher rates of aggressive triple-negative subtype, earlier age at diagnosis,
            and have a 39% higher mortality rate than Caucasian American women. African American
            women also have higher rates of obesity than Caucasian American women. Obesity and
            inflammation are also very closely linked to breast cancer. Obesity causes chronic
            inflammation, and is a risk factor for post-menopausal breast cancer and worse prognosis.
            This work looks at several effects of obesity-related inflammation in the progression
            of breast cancer. Bioinformatics was used to explore the differential expression of
            resistin, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has 4-fold higher expression in African
            American women. Due to the pro-inflammatory behavior, and role in adipose tissue,
            resistin may be a link between obesity, inflammation, and cancer. Resistin was differentially
            expressed in African American early-stage receptor negative subtypes. It was especially
            linked to estrogen receptor negative breast cancer subtype. Resistin expression was
            also higher in triple-negative subtype compared to luminal A subtype, which is hormone
            receptor positive. The high levels of resistin could contribute to African American
            breast cancer phenotype and high mortality rates. It may also serve as an early detection
            biomarker, since it is linked to early stages. Another effect of obesity that was
            analyzed in this work was the role of macrophages in breast cancer cell-adipocyte
            crosstalk. Obesity triggers increased infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue.
            An innovative cell co-culture system was used to study the paracrine interactions
            between adipocytes, macrophages, and breast cancer cells, and how they can benefit
            tumor progression. Macrophage conditioned media intensified the effects of breast
            cancer cell-adipocyte crosstalk. In this crosstalk, adipocytes become cancer-associated,
            meaning they become delipidated and increase production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
            Breast cancer cells then benefit from this increased inflammation and become more
            aggressive. Macrophage conditioned media in breast cancer cell and adipocyte co-culture
            increased tumor cell proliferation and migration compared to co-culture with nonconditioned
            media. Macrophage conditioned media also increased the expression of pro-inflammatory
            cytokines by adipocytes, even in the absence of breast cancer cells, although the
            expression levels were highest with all three cell components. Additionally, in co-culture
            of adipocytes and breast cancer cells with macrophage conditioned media, adipocytes
            showed signs of delipidation. Therefore, macrophages contribute to adipocyte inflammation
            and cancer-association, and help drive tumorigenesis.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Social-emotional learning has become a popular focus within the school setting, which
            is aimed at fostering the well-being of the “whole child.” These programs have encapsulated
            an array of different character strengths, skills, and aptitudes which nurture interpersonal
            relationships and promote effective social-behavioral competencies. One of the emerging
            areas of emphasis in social-emotional processes, is emotional intelligence (EI), a
            construct broadly referring to self- and other- emotional awareness that guides decision
            making and thinking. EI has predominated the adult literature but is only beginning
            to have a large focus within youth populations. Of those studies which exist in children
            and adolescents, EI has been associated with a number of strengths-based outcomes
            (e.g., increased life satisfaction, stronger peer relationships, decreased pathology
            and negative behaviors), and is considered a driving force for children’s future well-being
            and multi-dimensional functioning. Despite the emphasis on EI in both popular culture
            and scholarly pursuit, issues in conceptualization and measurement have prompted the
            need for an empirically sound and valid measure that can gauge youth’s level of EI.
            The present study proposes a novel way of evaluating EI in children, through a teacher-report
            form called the Pfeiffer EI Scale. This scale was constructed in an attempt to minimize
            concerns with existing instrumentation and provide a rating of children’s EI level
            that can be used in conjunction with SEL programming in schools. Items on the Pfeiffer
            EI Scale are based upon measurable and observable characteristics of EI, which span
            across ability-based, trait-based, and mixed models of EI. Previous analysis (through
            exploratory factor analysis) of this scale revealed strong internal reliability and
            an underlying three-factor solution of the scale, which measures Positive Expression
            of Emotions, Negative Expression of Emotions, and Understanding and Managing Emotions.
            This dissertation serves as a continuation of the preliminary psychometric analysis
            of the Pfeiffer EI Scale. To demonstrate factorial validity of the measure, confirmatory
            factor analysis was performed. A three-factor solution was verified from this analysis
            after re-specifying the model and comparing it against a uni-dimensional structure;
            however, fewer items were retained. With careful consideration to underlying theory
            and conceptualization of EI, a total of 15 items were dropped from the original 47-item
            scale due to low factor loading, high conceptual overlap with other items, and high
            modification index values. The remaining 32-item total scale and individual factors
            maintained excellent internal consistency reliability. In an attempt to establish
            convergent validity with existing measures, the Pfeiffer EI Scale was compared to
            existing student-completed EI instruments (Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence
            Test – Youth Version; Emotional-Quotient Inventory, Youth Version, and Schutte Self-Report
            Emotional Intelligence Scale). No statistically meaningful relationship was found
            between teacher-reported EI and ability-based EI. The total score of the Pfeiffer
            EI Scale and Understanding and Managing of Emotions factor was weakly related to the
            Stress Management domain and total score of mixed-model EI. Additionally, no relationship
            was found between teacher-reported EI and trait-based EI. No relationship was found
            between the teacher-reported EI and life satisfaction or affect, suggesting minimal
            concurrent validity. A mild positive relationship was found between grade point average
            and the Positive Expression of Emotions factor, Understanding and Managing of Emotions
            factor, and Total EI score. There was a negative, weak relationship between the Understanding
            and Managing of Emotions factor and disciplinary action, indicating that students
            with greater disciplinary offenses had decreased EI scores. Females performed stronger
            than males on most factors and the total Pfeiffer EI score. No differences were found
            across ethnic or racial groups on teacher-reported EI. Individuals with higher socio-economic
            status did receive higher scores on the Negative Expression of Emotions factor compared
            to those with lower socio-economic status. The only meaningful difference across ages
            was between 11- and 15-year-olds on the Positive Expression of Emotions factor, suggesting
            that EI did not differ much across age bands. Overall, despite having solid internal
            consistency reliability, the results provide minimal support for the convergent and
            concurrent validity of the Pfeiffer EI Scale. However, included within this dissertation
            are proposed rationale for factors impacting validity, including the “subjectivity”
            of the emotional experience, informant discrepancies commonly found between other-rater
            forms, and the over-extension of the concept of EI. Despite the contradictory findings
            to many hypotheses, this study provides a unique perspective on how EI may be measured
            within youth populations and inform clinical and assessment practices. Limitations
            of the current work and future directions of study are also discussed.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Flux synthesis is a useful method for the exploration and development of new tetrelide
            Zintl phases. Reactions of heavy divalent metals (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu, Yb) with tetrels
            (Tt = Si, Ge, Sn) in Mg/Al flux mixtures produce charge-balanced tetrelides with the
            general formula (A/Mg)2Tt; these compounds have hexagonal structures analogous to
            those of a large family of rare earth transition metal phosphides. Initial reactions
            of ytterbium, barium and silicon in Mg/Al melts produced three new phases: Ba2Yb0.9Mg11.1Si7,
            Ba5Yb2Mg17Si12, and Ba20Yb5Mg61Si43, isostructural to the ternary phosphides Zr2Fe12P7,
            Ho5Ni19P12, and Ho20Ni66P43 respectively. Later a fourth silicide (Ba6Yb1.84Mg18.16Si13,
            analogous to Zr6Ni20P13) was synthesized. All these phases exhibit Pauli paramagnetic
            behavior, indicative of divalent Yb2+ ions. From the density of states (DOS) calculations
            on Ba2Yb0.9Mg11.1Si7, Ba5Yb2Mg17Si12 and Ba6Yb1.84Mg18.16Si13, these compounds are
            expected to be poor metals/semimetallic. Due to the very complex nature of the Ba/Yb/Mg/Si
            system (there are four competing, structurally related compounds) quenching experiments
            and in situ neutron powder diffraction studies were carried out to determine the reaction
            parameters that favor certain products. Under slow cooling conditions, Ba5Yb2Mg17Si12
            precipitates from the flux at 800 °C. A faster cooling rate of an identical reaction
            results in the formation of single crystals of Ba20Yb5Mg61Si43 in the flux at 640
            °C. This indicates that the crystallization of products in this metal flux reaction
            does not involve precipitation and interconversion of different phases but instead
            depends on the rate of cooling across the supersaturated metastable zone in this system.
            The other two compounds (Ba2Yb0.9Mg11.1Si7 and Ba6Yb1.84Mg18.16Si13) were not seen
            in the in situ neutron diffraction experiments. These phases might form under rare
            and difficult to reproduce conditions (caused by temperature fluctuations that occur
            when opening the furnace door) that position the reaction at a specific point in the
            metastable zone. Further exploration of reactions of tetrels with divalent alkaline
            earth or rare earth metals in Mg/Al flux was carried out. All the (A/Mg)2Tt products
            are tetrelide analogs of hexagonal ternary phosphides (Zr2Fe12P7, Ho5Ni19P12, Zr6Ni20P13
            or Ho20Ni66P43 structure types). The charge-balanced stoichiometries result in semimetallic
            behavior, and the complex structures and heavy element incorporation yield low thermal
            conductivity, confirmed by thermoelectric measurements on two representative compounds.
            Ba5Eu2.85Mg16.15Si12 and Ba5Yb2.26Mg16.74Si12 have room temperature thermal conductivities
            of 2 – 3 W/mK, and Seebeck coefficients of +160 uV/K and -75 uV/K respectively, with
            Ba5Eu2.85Mg16.15Si12 exhibiting magnetoresistance around 2 K. These materials are
            promising for thermoelectric applications at high temperatures. Incorporation of europium
            results in compounds exhibiting very weak magnetic transitions at low temperatures.
            Magnetic susceptibility measurements on Ba5Eu2.85Mg16.15Si12 and Eu4.64Yb2.32Mg18.04Si12
            indicated that both phases show no ordering below 3 K and that their Eu ions are divalent.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The goal of nuclear structure experiments is to understand how properties of nuclei
            evolve as a function of key observables such as proton and neutron numbers, deformation,
            angular momentum and excitation energy, to name a few. In order to investigate how
            the nuclear structure evolves with these parameters, γ-ray spectroscopy can be utilized,
            which requires efficient γ-ray detection systems. This thesis details γ-ray spectroscopy
            to investigate the nuclear structure in a series of rare-earth nuclei using state
            of the art γ-ray detector systems. In the first part of this thesis, high-spin states
            in 179, 180 W (Z=74) produced via fusion-evaporation reactions carried out at Florida
            State University’s John D. Fox Laboratory are discussed. The reaction used to produce
            excited states in these nuclei was a 14C beam on an enriched 170 Er target, and the
            5n and 4n evaporation channels were studied to investigate 179, 180 W respectively.
            The emitted γ-rays were detected using three Compton-suppressed clover detectors and
            seven single element Compton-suppressed high-purity germanium detectors. In this experiment,
            852 million γ-γ coincidences and 82 million γ-γ-γ coincidences at 75 MeV beam energy
            were collected. Additionally, at a beam energy of 68 MeV, 119 million γ-γ coincidences
            and 9.6million γ-γ-γ coincidences. The primary purpose of this experiment was to add
            to a systematic investigation of band crossing frequencies in heavy tungsten nuclei
            in order to observe the effect of quasiparticle seniority and high rotational frequencies
            on pairing correlations. Additionally, due in part to results obtained from the first
            part of this analysis, new systematic data in the A ≈ 160 − 180 region is also discussed,
            with an emphasis on the role that pair-blocking effects play during the rotation of
            the nucleus. This systematic investigation builds upon the classic findings of Garrett
            et al. [1] who investigated systematically the critical band crossing frequencies
            resulting from the rotational alignment of the first pair of i_{13/2} neutrons (AB)
            in rare-earth nuclei. In that study, evidence was found for an odd-even neutron number
            dependence attributed to changes in the strength of neutron pairing correlations.
            The present work carries out a similar investigation at higher rotational frequencies
            for the second pair of aligning i_{13/2} neutrons (BC), advancing the work started
            by Scott Miller, formerly of the Riley group [2]. Again, a systematic difference in
            band crossing frequencies is observed between odd-N and even-N Er, Yb, Hf, and W nuclei,
            but in the BC case, it is opposite to the AB neutron-number dependence. These results
            are discussed in terms of a reduction of neutron pairing correlations at high rotational
            frequencies and of the effects of Pauli blocking on the pairing field by higher-seniority
            configurations. Also playing a significant role are the changes in deformation with
            proton and neutron number, the changes of location of single-particle orbitals as
            a function of quadrupole deformation, and the position of the Fermi surface with regard
            to the various Ω (projection of total angular momentum I onto the symmetry axis) components
            of the neutron i_{13/2} shell. The second part of this thesis discusses in detail
            the nuclear structure of 160 Gd and highlights some new band structures in 155 Sm
            and 161 Gd. Two reactions were carried out to produce a multitude of neutron-rich
            isotopes performed at the Argonne Tandem Linear Accelerator System (ATLAS) at Argonne
            National Laboratory (ANL). Firstly, a 160 Gd beam of energy at 1000 MeV was impinged
            on a 154Sm target and then in a second experiment on a 164 Dy target. The goal of
            the deep-inelastic collisions was to provide a mechanism to reach a number of neutron-rich
            isotopes, in particular those from the mid-shell region in rare-earth nuclei. Although
            many neutron-rich nuclei were produced, they were not populated strongly enough to
            see new results. However, a byproduct of the reactions was the strong Coulomb excitation
            of the 160 Gd beam. Many excited states in 160Gd were produced, and as a result, a
            spectroscopic analysis of 160Gd was carried out, and will be discussed in detail in
            this thesis. Additionally, new γ-ray transitions in other isotopes such as 155Sm and
            161Gd were also produced and will be discussed. The Gammasphere detector array was
            used to detect γ-rays from the excited nuclei, because of its sensitivity to cleanly
            delineate the vast number of multi-nucleon transfer reaction channels. As a result
            of both analysis, many new decay transitions and new energy levels were observed in
            the aforementioned nuclei. Whenever possible, the intensities, angular correlations,
            spins, parities, and rotational behaviors of these newly discovered states were analyzed.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The unique physical properties of nanoparticles depend on their sizes and shapes.
            Therefore, an ability to precisely control the size of nanoparticles and tune their
            morphology will allow scientists and engineers to modify their physical properties,
            which will lead to many potential applications. To precisely control nanoparticles'
            sizes and shapes requires a deep understanding of their growth mechanism. To understand
            their growth mechanism, a direct observation and its quantitative analysis are both
            necessary. In the direct observation study, the electron microscopy method has shown
            promises, because the \textit{in situ} method enables researchers to see the growth
            process using video recordings. In these video recordings, each frame displays an
            image from an electron microscope. However, this method yields a vast number of electron
            images; therefore, analyzing these images to monitor the nanoparticles' growth is
            a challenging task. The objective of this dissertation is to develop an automation
            process to capture the complex growth event of nanoparticles in a sequence of electron
            microscope images. The automation process consists of two tasks: detect nanoparticles
            in an electron microscope image that has a non-uniform background and significant
            noise; and then track these detected nanoparticles in a large number of video frames
            obtained from a single camera. In each frame, complex interaction among these nanoparticles
            exists; therefore, the tracking algorithm will capture the complex interaction among
            these nanoparticles. Two solutions are proposed in this dissertation. To detect nanoparticles,
            an electron microscope image is converted to a binary image through a process called
            image binarization. To perform the image binarization step, the background of the
            electron microscope image is first estimated with a robust regression technique; then,
            it is subtracted from the input image. Afterwards, a global thresholding algorithm
            is applied to the subtracted outcome in order to achieve the binary image. To track
            these detected nanoparticles in a large number of video frames, an online algorithm
            has been created. This algorithm leverages the multi-way data association, which is
            capable of tracking complex interaction among nanoparticles but suffers from computational
            inefficiency for a large number of video frames. The online algorithm forms fragmented
            trajectories between two consecutive frames (i.e. frame-by-frame data association).
            When missed-association between nanoparticles occur, the algorithm augments these
            missed-associated nanopartiles to nanoparticles in the second frame in the frame-by-frame
            data association step. Then, the algorithm continues forming trajectories with the
            multi-way data association for the incoming video frame. When these augmented nanoparticles
            are associated within the sliding window, the algorithm initiates the creation of
            tracks, which connect missed-associated nanoparticles at their respective time frames
            to their correspondents at the incoming video frame. While working on the second solution,
            we also created a computer simulation model to generate multi-target datasets with
            their respective ground-truth associations.The generated datasets and their respective
            ground-truth associations will serve as a benchmark data to test and evaluate multi-target
            tracking algorithms. The simulation model serves two purposes: cover all complexity
            of multi-target tracking scenarios, which public datasets lack; and provide the ground-truth
            target tracking and association so that the evaluation of multi-target tracking algorithms
            can be performed without any manual video annotation process.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The goal for this thesis is to present a historical, and archaeological assessment
            of the nineteenth century occupations at the Mission San Luis de Talimali (8Le04)
            site. San Luis is a multicomponent site that has seen Native American, Spanish, and
            nineteenth and twentieth century occupations. While there has been a limited amount
            of research on the nineteenth century at San Luis, I looked to synthesis past research
            and present my own contributions toward understanding this period of time at San Luis.
            Historic research on this topic was previously undertaken by Elizabeth Monroe (1984),
            which was heavily consulted and cited as I pursued my own historic research. Before
            addressing what the archaeological record can demonstrate, I presented all the known
            information of the nineteenth century at San Luis from the documentary record. Attention
            was also placed on the information acquired through the 1936 WPA interview of Louis
            Napoleon, who was enslaved on San Luis prior to emancipation. This historic research
            was pursued to assist in the interpretation of the subsurface surveys undertaken at
            San Luis. The nineteenth century material culture from two subsurface surveys were
            analyzed, and presented as distribution maps to understand the artifact-patterning
            representative of this period in San Luis’ history. Dr. Gary Shapiro’s 1984 auger
            survey, and his subsequent report 1987 report, was presented along with the posthole
            survey undertaken in 2018 by Dr. Tanya Peres. I look to present data that helps clarify
            some of the uncertainties surrounding the nineteenth century at San Luis. This thesis
            was undertaken to understand the potential location of the San Luis plantation main
            house, the presence of nineteenth century road on San Luis’ landscape, the location
            of nineteenth century structures, and if there can be any determination of areas where
            there was slave activity. What is known from the documentary record, and the interview
            of Napoleon, was used alongside the distribution of nineteenth century material culture
            from the subsurface testing at San Luis to answer these questions. However, this thesis
            was also conducted to highlight the need to consider all components of an archaeological
            site, and to give voice to those whose history was not recorded in the documentary
            record,

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Halide Perovskites have recently risen as a new class of optoelectronic materials.
            Remarkable optical and electrical properties have led to the demonstration of various
            perovskite-based devices such as solar cells1, LEDs2-5, photodetectors6 and lasers7,8.
            Particularly, perovskite solar cells have reached &gt;24% of the energy conversion efficiency
            and outperformed most of the single-junction thin film solar cells available on the
            market1. Unfortunately, most of the perovskite-based devices remained more-or-less
            unstable due to a series of unusual behaviors such as current-voltage hysteresis9
            and photo-induced phase segregation10,11. Studies about the underlying mechanisms
            are in demand. In this dissertation, I focused on studying the charge transport and
            photoresponse of halide perovskites to reveal the mechanisms related to material stability,
            particularly under electrical and optical stimuli. The changes of halide perovskite
            materials in a device under electrical operation were studied by using a microscopic
            tool, scanning photocurrent microscopy. The results showed the dynamic nature of the
            doping concentration in the hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3, as a function of the external
            biasing voltages. Further studies on the synthesis methods showed such a dynamic process
            could be attributed to electric field-assisted ion migration mainly through defect
            sites. The partial suppression of ion migration was observed in materials processed
            at higher temperature. Except the electric-field triggered instability of the internal
            potential distribution, while under illumination, a different type of stability, the
            phase stability in mixed-halide perovskites attracted a lot of attention. Phase separation
            in mixed-halide perovskites under illumination was a tough problem, which directly
            related to the degradation of desired device performance. In this dissertation, the
            correlation between the phase stability and morphology was discovered. A model based
            on thermodynamics was developed to explain such a correlation. Based on the thermodynamic
            model, the composite materials CsPbX3/Cs4PbX6 with guest-host structures were created
            with the phase separation problem successfully solved. Furthermore, the composites
            are sustainably functionalized even under extreme conditions, i.e., under extremely
            intense illumination, making the composited useful for devices required to work in
            extreme conditions. The optical and electrical properties of CsPbX3/Cs4PbX6 composites
            were further investigated for the application of such composites to functional devices.
            Surprisingly, the presence of the photoluminescence inactive Cs4PbBr6 can significantly
            enhance the light emitting efficiency of CsPbBr3 in the composites. The unique negative
            thermal quenching observed near the liquid nitrogen temperature indicates that a type
            of shallow states generated at the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 interfaces is responsible for
            the enhancement of photoluminescence. Finally, light emitting diodes based on CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6
            composites are demonstrated. Both quantum efficiency and emission brightness are improved
            significantly compared with similar devices constructed using pure CsPbBr3. The unfavorable
            charge transport property of host matrix Cs4PbBr6 could be circumvented by optimizing
            the ratio between the host and the guest components and the total thickness of the
            composite thin films. The inorganic composition of the emitting layer also leads to
            improved device stability under the condition of continuous operation. The studies
            in this dissertation indicated great potentials of composite materials with optimized
            designed properties. Depends on the application purposes, more matrix materials with
            the combination of halide perovskites need to be explored. The future plan will more
            directed to the investigations of fundamental photophysics and charge transport in
            a large collection of compositing combinations.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>As people continue to live longer, there are more opportunities to acquire a chronic
            illness or disability in their lifetime. The onset and diagnosis of illnesses such
            as Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) has such a subtle and insidious onset that individuals may
            go undiagnosed. Over 30 million adults in the United States have been diagnosed with
            a form of diabetes. With the increasing numbers of people experiencing chronic illness,
            understanding how the person navigates the process of adjustment will be of high importance
            to rehabilitation professionals. By applying the social comparison theory and the
            theory of adjustment to disability, the present study aimed to answer three research
            questions: 1) What are the relationships among perceived health status, self-esteem,
            social comparison orientation and adjustment to T2D?, 2) What are the impacts of perceived
            health status, self-esteem, social comparison orientation on the adjustment to T2D
            above and beyond the factors of age and gender?, and 3) To what extent does self-esteem,
            perceived health status, social comparison orientation scores (including upward and
            downward social comparison scores) predict adjustment to disability based on age?
            A sample of 136 adults with type 2 diabetes throughout the state of Florida responded
            to the online survey. A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to analyze
            the data. In the age group of 21 to 34-year old participants, upward social comparison
            orientation was a significant predictor of adjustment to disability. For ages 51 to
            65, the significant predictors of adjustment to disability were self-esteem score
            and downward social comparison orientation score. These findings present rehabilitation
            professionals with a means of understanding and exploring the individual differences
            in the factors related to adjustment to disability.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The purpose of this study was to explore the issue of social class in art education.
            As mentioned in my theoretical framework underlying this study, Bourdieu (1973/2000)
            used the term cultural capital as forms of knowledge, tastes, and practices to explain
            the relationship between knowledge and power in the field of education. I employed
            Bourdieu’s concepts of cultural capital to further develop my argument on the relationship
            between social class and visual arts education. By using qualitative comparative case
            study methods, I examined the similarities and differences in the implementation of
            visual art education between two selected third-grade classes with distinct aggregations
            of student socioeconomic status, yet taught by the same itinerant art teacher in the
            same county¬. I scrutinized and compared the two cases with respect to their overall
            access to art education resources, including funding, materials, and allotment of
            time for instruction; the art-related knowledge, values, and skills taught and emphasized
            in each art classroom; the similarities and differences between the two cases in terms
            of how art instruction was implemented and the art teacher’s reasons for differentiating
            or not differentiating art instruction. This study was conducted in a metropolitan
            area in Virginia. I used purposeful sampling to select my participant—one itinerant
            visual art teacher, who traveled between and worked at a Title 1 elementary school
            and another elementary school within a relatively affluent area with a much lower
            rate of students eligible for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). The difference
            in the percentages of students enrolling in the NSLP between these two schools is
            up to 73%. The fieldwork took place from October 2017 until March 2018. Through fieldwork,
            I collected data through observation, interviews, and relevant document collection.
            I then organized and analyzed the collected data during April 2018 to November 2018
            and began to write the findings in December 2018. My data analysis strategies included
            writing initial codes and memos, generating patterns and themes, and selecting cross-cases
            themes and topics. The cross-case comparison identified the following findings: (1)
            the economic and racial/ethnic differences between the two school communities; (2)
            the disparities in external educational resources; (3) the differences in students’
            learning foundations and inspirations; (4) the emphasis on formalist aesthetics and
            craftsmanship in art instruction aligning with Virginia’s Visual Art Standards; (5)
            the different in students’ learning outcomes in art; and (6) the different cultures
            of learning between the two classes. Holding postmodern perspectives as my philosophical
            framework for this study, I value the local contexts in which I conducted this study
            and encourage readers to construct their own judgment and interpretation. Expanding
            upon my findings, I provided the implications of my study for visual arts coordinators
            and administrators, art education practitioners, and art teacher training programs
            in higher education. To further investigate the issue of social class in art education,
            I also recommended a multitude of relevant issues with methodologies to be used in
            future research.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Social media has been implicated as a correlate and a cause of increased disordered
            eating in men and women. Yet, little is known about how specific aspects of social
            media impact eating disorder pathology. Through utilization of a two-stage study,
            including a large correlational design and an experimental design, the present study
            sought to determine how posting photos of the self that have been edited (self-photo
            editing) on Instagram relates to disordered eating in male and female college students.
            In the first stage, the association between disordered eating and self-photo editing
            was examined in a large sample of undergraduates. Participants for the second stage
            were regular self-photo editors who were randomly assigned to either edit or not edit
            a photo of themselves and post or not post that photo on Instagram. Assessments of
            momentary levels of eating disorder risk factors and urges to engage in exercise and
            dietary restraint were taken before and after the experimental manipulation and at
            24-hour follow-up. A repeated-measures ANOVA was used to assess editing, posting,
            and their interaction as predictors of changes in eating disorder risk factors and
            features across time points. While those who self-photo edit have higher levels of
            disordered eating than those who do not, anxiety symptoms were similarly increased
            in self-photo editors. Experimental results showed no causal associations between
            self-photo editing and disordered eating, but did demonstrate causal associations
            between posting and anxiety. Results suggest that anxiety symptoms, rather than disordered
            eating, are significantly impacted by posting photos of the self, whether or not photos
            are edited. Examining the impact of social media use may represent an important avenue
            for future anxiety research.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>This dissertation traces the discursive and political history of abortion and concludes
            “abortion” is an ideograph, a term coined by Michael Calvin McGee to describe an ultimate
            term or slogan representing an ideology and acts as a motivating force in political
            discourse. Next, this dissertation examines the role of abortion as ideograph during
            the Susan G. Komen/Planned Parenthood social media crisis in 2012 and its impact on
            brand image. The crisis threatened Komen's reputation; thus, exemplifying the characteristics
            of a paracrisis (Coombs &amp; Holladay, 2012) and revealed dissonance between brand identity
            and brand image. Prior to the crisis, candidates running for office had pledged to
            eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood and emphasized its role as the nation's "largest
            abortion provider." To shift the narrative from abortion provider to health care provider,
            Planned Parenthood leveraged the attention generated by the crisis to enhance its
            brand image. The following artifacts were selected for analysis: media reports, legislation
            and court cases about abortion, comments posted during the crisis to Komen’s Facebook
            page, blog posts, and press releases of advocacy groups and congressional leaders.
            A rhetorical analysis of the texts revealed rhetors viewed Komen’s action as a political
            decision in response to conflicting ideological beliefs about abortion. Komen’s longstanding
            partnership with Planned Parenthood and the use of “pro-choice” language in its brand
            communication facilitated a brand image of Komen as supporting the right of a woman
            to make choices relevant to her personal circumstances. The news that Komen would
            be “halting grants to Planned Parenthood” prompted Komen’s publics to reevaluate their
            understanding of the organization’s brand values. Pro-life supporters understood Komen's
            decision as an acknowledgment of the harmful effects of abortion to women while pro-choice
            supporters viewed the decision as a betrayal of its brand values. The crisis demonstrates
            the power of ideographs to motivate and unite like-minded publics; however, the ideograph
            can also pose a threat to brand credibility by dividing organizational publics along
            ideological lines. Komen’s failure to understand its brand image as supportive of
            women’s right to choice led to organizational action viewed as contrary to brand values
            and resulted in the loss of brand equity.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The state of Florida annually approves 7.4×105 hectares (1.8×106 acres) of prescribed
            fires, and the production of particulate matter (PM) may cause health issues for neighboring
            communities. Incomplete combustion of biomass leads to the production of abundant
            amounts of concentrated PM. PM smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), may have
            adverse effects on respiratory and cardiovascular health, as shown in earlier studies.
            Excessive exposure to PM2.5 may lead to diseases such as respiratory distress, asthma,
            heart disease, cancer, and death. In this study, the distribution and effects of PM2.5
            caused by prescribed burns of sugarcane crops during the harvest season are simulated
            and evaluated. This research uses archived data of prescribed fires records from 2008-2015
            from the FFS open burn authorizations (OBA). The fires occur during the sugarcane
            harvest season from Fall (October) until Winter (typically March). We simulate the
            concentrations of PM2.5 from these fires using the HYSPLIT atmospheric dispersion
            model driven by meteorology from the North American Mesoscale (NAM) weather model.
            The results are evaluated against the wind, precipitation, humidity observations,
            emission factors, locations of fires as reported by Florida Forestry Services (FFS)
            and observed concentration values reported by the Environmental Protection Agency
            (EPA). Errors occurred due to the uncertainties and variability in emission factors,
            fire location, and fire size. The simulation results were then used to evaluate mortality
            caused by PM2.5 from sugarcane fires in Florida.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Dual language learners who come from low-income backgrounds are at-risk for experiencing
            a word gap in the amount of language they hear before kindergarten entry compared
            to peers of middle- and high-income backgrounds (Fernald, Marchman, &amp; Weisleder, 2013;
            Hart &amp; Risley, 1995). Spanish-English dual language learners are more likely to be
            in family-based childcare in their early childhood (National Center for Education
            Statistics, 2017), meaning they rely more heavily on caregiver language during important
            periods of neurodevelopment. This study aimed to intervene with caregivers of young
            children from Spanish-English-speaking low-income families. The intervention used
            a language input feedback device called Starling by Versame and its corresponding
            application on an iPad to provide caregiver word counts alongside visual displays
            of language input across the day. In a multiple-baseline design, three cohorts of
            participating families accessed the Starling device and application and tracked their
            daily adult word counts with visual displays. Day-long LENA recordings were collected
            throughout the baseline and intervention phases in order to select 15-minute segments
            of interaction selected from high-priority contexts characterized by increased caregiver-child
            interactivity. By observing the adult word count across the 15-minute segments, the
            results of this study observed a limited effect of the Starling intervention on quantity
            of language input across a hierarchy of contexts. Visual analysis of data characterized
            its limited effect across participant families based on changes in level, trends,
            and overlapping data across phases, among other features of visual data. Hierarchical
            linear modeling further revealed statistically the limited effect of the Starling
            on caregiver word counts in distinct contexts across all participating families. Participants
            completed an exit questionnaire regarding the social validity of the technology-based
            intervention and rated the intervention as socially and culturally valid. This study
            contributed novel evidence pertaining to the use of a quantity-focused language input
            feedback intervention and the social validity of a technology-based intervention with
            families of Spanish-English speaking backgrounds living in low-income conditions.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Approximately 20% of children in the United States meet criteria for an emotional
            or behavioral disorder, including internalizing symptoms such as anxiety and depression,
            and externalizing symptoms such as conduct and oppositional defiance disorders (Ogundele,
            2018). Evidence-based parenting interventions are one avenue of treatment designed
            to reduce symptoms of child emotional and behavioral disorders by promoting positive
            parenting practices that reduce risk for negative child outcomes. Additional research
            in the last decade of parenting interventions has also shown that parent psychosocial
            health (e.g., self-esteem, self-efficacy, anxiety) improved as a result of parent
            participation in these interventions. These positive, yet unexpected parent outcomes
            have generated a new body of research focused on the processes (i.e., internal emotions,
            beliefs) through which these positive changes to parent mental health occurred. Further,
            parenting intervention researchers have also begun to test core elements of the intervention
            in order to determine whether behavior-based skills or emotion-focused skills led
            to these positive parent outcomes. What remains unclear, however, is how these changes
            occurred. Researchers propose that emotion regulation (ER) skills (e.g., awareness
            of reactivity; capacity to manage internal distress) may be associated with positive
            changes to symptoms of parent mental health challenges. However, most parenting programs
            do not include ER content. Shifting parenting programs to include ER content has the
            potential to improve parent mental health and reduce symptoms of child emotional and
            behavioral problems. Only one previous qualitative study (Holtrop, Parra-Cardona &amp;
            Forgatch, 2014) has examined parent’s process of change via shifts in behavior-focused
            parenting skills after an intervention. Additional research is needed to determine
            parents’ perceptions of an intervention promoting ER skills and the unique role of
            emotions in reducing mental health symptoms and improving child outcomes. The purpose
            of this study, therefore, was to assess parent’s perceptions on the utility of ER
            skills, as well as illuminate the skill-building process of implementing an ER task
            in order to derive implications for ER content inclusion in parenting interventions.
            Project aims were accomplished through the following research questions: (1) How do
            parents describe their own emotion regulation process? and, (2) How do parents perceive
            and process the ER implementation task? The term “process” in the context of this
            study includes close examination of parent in-depth experiences, perceptions, and
            actions taken to implement the ER task. Qualitative data were collected from 17 parents
            (8 fathers and 9 mothers) with 100% of participants completing the pre and post-implementation
            interviews (34 total interviews). Data were analyzed using grounded theory analysis
            via open, axial and selective coding to generate empirical evidence for parents use
            of ER skills. Findings illustrated that parents navigated through three phases amid
            describing their existing understanding of ER, and developed greater awareness of
            self and their child as they applied the ER implementation task. These experiences
            were grouped into three main phases, across pre-implementation and post-implementation
            contexts: (1) A Priori Knowledge of ER, (2) “It’s Definitely Not Common Practice”:
            The ER Learning Process, and (3) “Stop and Think”: Developing Awareness and Insight.
            Across these phases, parents emphasized the importance of ER skills in their own lives,
            and the meaningful progress made to improve parent-child interactions. Additionally,
            parents emphasized the cognitive effort in which they engaged in order to attempt
            regulation (e.g., focused attention, self-monitoring). Results of this study provide
            additional insight into the utility of ER skills in parenting interventions, and encourage
            researchers to consider ER skills as a potential mechanism of change.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The medium voltage dc (MVDC) power system is gaining increasing attention in applications
            such as renewable energy and shipboard power systems due to its advantages in reliability,
            efficiency, power quality and power density. However, the short-circuit fault management
            in a MVDC system is a key issue because of the lack of natural zero-crossing point
            and conventional mechanical circuit breaker (CB) design challenge. So solid state
            CBs (SSCB) or hybrid CBs (HCB) are under development to enable the breaker-based fault
            protection approach. Another breaker-less approach utilizing the inherent current-limiting
            capability of power semiconductor devices is also promising in a MVDC system. The
            state-of-the-art of the two fault management approaches are reviewed. This thesis
            is focused on developing a technology originated from the breaker-less method to improve
            the performance of breaker-based fault protection approach. In the shipboard breaker-based
            MVDC system, converters are normally shut down to react to the fault. The diodes freewheeling
            phenomenon is a concern but a quantitative analysis is still not available. Moreover,
            the potential of converter during fault has not been exploited completely. Considering
            large number of converters already existing in the shipboard MVDC system, the overall
            benefits at no extra hardware cost may be significant. Therefore, a converter fault
            ride through (FRT) strategy aiming at improving CB operation is proposed in this thesis.
            The proposed research found that there are some converters located in parallel with
            activated CBs during the fault and thus, active fault current sharing (FCS) by these
            converters are possible. In addition, this peak fault current reduction effect on
            CBs can be amplified from the systematic perspective because multiple CBs in various
            fault scenarios can be benefited from a single converter. As a first step, the short-circuit
            fault scenarios of a shipboard breaker-based MVDC system are analyzed comprehensively
            and fault equivalent circuits including power converters adjacent to CBs are developed.
            The equivalent circuits are analyzed mathematically and the reaction of passive mode
            converters to the fault are discussed, which can be a benchmark to evaluate the proposed
            active FCS strategy. Next, the proposed converter FCS strategy to reduce the CB fault
            current is illustrated in detail, together with the device stress analysis. Finally,
            the experimental verifications on a down-scaled test setup are provided.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>The ability to construct radial wind profiles of tropical cyclones (TC) from limited
            observations is crucial to the initialization of TC simulations and predictions. A
            minimum requirement for constructing a reasonable radial wind profile is a high skill
            in estimating one of the four TC characteristic parameters, namely maximum wind speed
            (Vmax), radius of maximum wind speed (rmax), 17 ms−1 wind speed (V17), and radius
            of 17 ms−1 wind (r17) from the other three. In this study, we put froth an absolute
            angular momentum (AAM) based analytical model for inferring the radial profile beyond
            the rmax from observations of these four parameters. An observed AAM loss L is defined
            as the ratio of the observed AAM at r17 to that at rmax. We parameterize the observed
            AAM loss L as an analytical function of these four parameters and environmental factors.
            The combination of analytical expressions of the AAM loss L and the AAM at r17 and
            rmax, gives us the analytical model. This observation-physics model allows us to construct
            radial profiles of TCs under four different configurations from observations of these
            four parameters. Specifically, we can use Vmax and rmax as inputs for solving (a)
            the tangential velocity profile of a TC from rmax to r17 or (b) the TC’s radius for
            a given tangential velocity from Vmax to V17. Alternatively, we can use V17 and r17
            as inputs for solving (c) the tangential velocity profile of a TC from r17 to rmax
            or (d) the TC’s radius for a given tangential velocity from V17 to Vmax. This enables
            us to acquire radial wind profiles when one of the four parameters is not available
            in observations. The degree of consistency of (a) versus (c) and (b) versus (d) is
            an indicator of the robustness of the model. We evaluate the skill of our model using
            4491 records of 197 named TCs derived from the Extended Best Track Dataset for the
            period of 1998-2016, and find that the mean errors in estimating Vmax, rmax, V17,
            and r17 are, respectively, 5.95 m/s, 25.37 km, 3.33 m/s, and 57.67 km. The proposed
            model has several advantages over widely recognized existing TC wind profile models.
            Most empirical models, for example, are designed to construct radial wind profiles
            in only one of the four configurations. While other physics-based models have mean
            errors in Vmax, rmax, and r17 that are larger by several factors. Furthermore, our
            model can yield physically realistic radial wind profiles and solutions of TC characteristic
            parameters (meaning that for radial wind profiles, wind velocity decreases monotonically
            from rmax to r17, and for solutions, Vmax &gt; V17 &gt; 0 and r17 &gt; rmax &gt; 0) for all 4491
            TC records, regardless of which of the four configurations is chosen. For more than
            10% of the TC records, however, other physics-based models have radial wind profiles
            that are discrete or increases from the inside to outside, and have solutions that
            either do not exist or are not physical under certain configurations.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Children with visual impairments have unique learning needs because visual impairment
            impacts a child’s ability to learn incidentally though observation (Lowenfeld, 1952,
            1973). Literature suggests children with visual impairments do not perform independent
            living skills at the same level as their peers with typical vision (e.g., Lewis &amp;
            Iselin, 2002). Teachers of students with visual impairments (TVIs) struggle to find
            time to teach independent living skills during the school day (e.g., Lohmeier, Blankenship,
            &amp; Hatlen, 2009), but caregivers may have the time and motivation to prioritize these
            skills at home. Caregiver coaching has been shown to increase the skills of caregivers
            of children with disabilities (e.g., Marturana &amp; Woods, 2012); however, coaching models
            have not yet been widely applied to caregivers of children with visual impairments.
            Some researchers have applied teleconferencing technologies to provide access to coaching
            and successfully build the capacity of caregivers of children with disabilities (e.g.,
            Baharav &amp; Reiser, 2010). As such, telepractice coaching was explored as a tool to
            bridge physical distance between coaches with expertise in educating children with
            visual impairments and caregivers who have the opportunity to implement instruction
            in independent living skills for their children with visual impairments. A single
            case, multiple baseline across contexts design was used to implement a telepractice
            caregiver coaching intervention in the homes of three caregiver-child dyads for two
            to three times a week over about 10 weeks. The included children were tactual learners
            with no other significant disabilities aged 5 to 11 years old. The study sought to
            answer the questions: (a) does telepractice coaching with the Family Guided Routines
            Based Intervention (FGRBI) coaching model (e.g., Woods, 2017) increase caregiver correct
            use of coached instructional strategies during independent living skills routines
            with their children who have visual impairments? and (b) does caregiver use of coached
            instructional strategies increase the child’s independent completion of independent
            living skills tasks? Because the coaching intervention was only implemented across
            all three contexts in one dyad, data from that dyad only can be considered as evidence
            of the effectiveness of the intervention. In that dyad, the caregiver increased her
            skills above baseline levels in all three contexts and demonstrated mastery in two
            contexts. However, great variability in the data make it difficult to conclude with
            certainty that there is a functional relation between telepractice caregiver coaching
            and caregiver instructional strategy use in teaching her child with a visual impairment.
            In addition, instructional skills learned in one skill context were generalized by
            some caregivers to other independent living skills contexts without coaching. Challenges
            with the length and duration of sessions caused concern regarding the social validity
            of the intervention. However, data collected after the study from participants and
            an external rater as well as maintenance data suggested high social validity of the
            intervention. Findings suggest the use of telepractice to deliver interactive caregiver
            coaching should be further investigated to determine its effectiveness to increase
            both caregiver instructional skills and the independent living skills of children
            with visual impairments. If telepractice is found to be effective, TVIs may benefit
            from using telepractice coaching to build relationships and strengthen capacity within
            the families of their students. Further research is necessary to examine the use of
            the telepractice coaching intervention to meet the needs of families and children
            with diverse characteristics, explore the role of siblings as peer models, and expand
            the role of the child in coaching. Further, the composition of the telepractice coaching
            intervention should be investigated to determine which intervention components may
            be most effective for which families, and how frequently they should be delivered
            for maximum efficiency.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Two big questions in physics beyond the Standard Model of particles are nature of
            Dark Matter and a theory of Quantum Gravity. In this work, topics related to both
            of these improtant questions are presented. First, we introduce an effective theory
            for soft and collinear limits of gravitational scatterings. It is a well-known fact
            that amplitudes including gravitons are inherently difficult to calculate. Our effective
            theory in its target phase space, substantially simplifies calculations of scattering
            amplitudes including gravtions. Our step by step procedure gives all the relevant
            operators at leading and next to leading powers for any full theory that couples to
            gravitons. In addition, the soft graviton theorem and decoupling of collinear gravitons
            at the leading power are manifest from the outset in the effective symmetries of the
            theory. At the next-to-leading power, certain simple structures of amplitudes, which
            are completely obscure in Feynman diagrams of the full theory, are also revealed.
            We will also discuss how ambiguity in choice of light-cone coordinates introduces
            fundamental redundancies in Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). SCET Lagrangian
            should be invariant under these transformations of coordinates, and the constraints
            from these transformations further reduce calculations needed for a scattering process.
            Second, thermal freeze-out of WIMPs can provide a unified origin of dark matter and
            baryon abundances in our universe. We show that this mechanism exhibits rich collider
            phenomenology. The collider signatures we point out can be tested at the current and
            future experiments at the LHC, even if the WIMPs are not charged under Standard Model
            and higgs interactions. In particular, the simplest such implementation can already
            offer a very clean signal of a TeV-scale resonance that decays to diphotons with a
            cross section that can easily be within the reach of the current and near-future LHC
            runs in the region of parameter space that leads to a successful baryogenesis. Other
            characteristic signatures include the production of multi-bottom and/or multi-top
            quarks, promptly or displaced. An even more exotic possibility is the production of
            two separate sets of isolated emerging jets connected by a charged track, which may
            require new dedicated studies. Finally, di-nucleon decay can also provide a powerful
            probe of the mechanism.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Conductive materials are indispensable for almost all aspects of life. However, conventional
            metal conductors have some drawbacks including heavy weight and corrosion issues.
            Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising as an alternative conductor that offers multiple
            advantages and functionalities including low density, corrosion resistance, and high
            specific mechanical/electrical/thermal properties. Much work has been done to improve
            the electrical conductivity of CNT assemblies, transferring the excellent properties
            of CNTs demonstrate at the nanoscale to practical applications such as fiber and films
            remains a challenge. This research focuses on studying the improvement of electrical/mechanical
            performance of CNT fibers/films. . Chapter 1 gives an introduction of CNT conductors.
            A comprehensive literature review of CNT conductor development is presented in Chapter
            2. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 discuss three projects focuses on synergistic effects, interface
            design and scalable fabrication, respectively. Conclusions are given in Chapter 6.
            We attempted to improve the electrical conductivity of CNT films based on synergistic
            effects though alignment and chemical doping. We fabricated large-scale continuous
            CNT sheets with ultra-high and stable electrical conductivity, which reached a conductivity
            in the range of 104 S/cm. We also investigated the interface structural optimization
            between CNTs and carbon matrix to simultaneously enhance strength and conductivity.
            To achieve this, a unique interface enhancer, pyrolyzed polydopamine (py-PDA), was
            added between the CNTs and carbon matrix, which resulted in better load transfer and
            electron transport. The as-prepared CNT/py-PDA/C composite fibers demonstrated remarkable
            improvements in electrical conductivity (2.1 × 103 S/cm) and tensile strength (up
            to 727 MPa), which should prove to be advantageous comparing to previously reported
            CNT/C composites. We also studied and developed a roll-to-roll production capability
            to fabricate continuous nanotube sheets or buckypaper with relatively high and stable
            conductivity. The electrical conductivity of the resultant continuous buckypaper can
            be improved to 7.6 × 104 S/m by using an oxidant chemical (i.e. HNO3 and I2) doping
            method. Those results are valuable for seeking lightweight and flexible non-metal
            conductors for potential engineering applications.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Urban growth causes environmental changes on a global scale. Coastal regions which
            undergo fast landscape transitions and population growth are facing higher risks from
            ecological degradation and severe natural hazards. However, the impacts of urban growth
            on species’ richness and people’s vulnerability to hazards are quite complex and diverse.
            The development of efficient coastal plans requires much deeper understanding of urban
            growth and its socioecological consequences. This dissertation proposes a GIScience
            based approach integrating remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS) and
            landscape ecology to evaluate urban growth and its impact in coastal landscapes. My
            dissertation consists of three major parts: analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics
            of landscape changes caused by urban growth; examining the impact of urban growth
            on habitat fragmentation and biodiversity; and characterizing the heterogeneity of
            coastal vulnerability and analyze the relationship with urban growth. My dissertation
            research aims to develop a better understanding of the interactions between the urban
            growth and the surrounding natural systems. The variable selection method used in
            coastal urban mapping can be applied to other spectrally heterogeneous areas. The
            assessment of urban spatiotemporal structure and coastal vulnerability can provide
            critical insights in the ecological and social inequality so that can be instructional
            for coastal planning and natural resource management.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Human capital resources (HCR) are thought to be one of the most important resources
            for organizations. Although HCR have been the focus of considerable research, relatively
            little attention has been devoted to the nature of HCR or the extent to which extant
            measures capture the construct. For example, some HCR measures used in prior research
            capture only part of the construct, and other measures appear to capture other constructs
            altogether. The overarching goal of the present dissertation is to better understand
            the nature, measurement, and effects of HCR. To do so, I use theory and prior research
            to delineate the different elements of HCR, as well as how HCR differ from potential
            antecedents of HCR. I then use meta-analysis to test three main issues: 1) whether
            HCR are distinct from the potential antecedents of HCR, including education, work
            experience, and high performance work practices (HPWPs); 2) whether HCR comprise distinct
            elements and how those elements relate to collective performance; 3) whether HCR have
            a stronger relation with collective performance than its antecedents. I also examine
            several variables that may moderate relations between HCR and collective performance,
            such as the level of analysis (e.g., unit- vs. firm-level performance). A meta-analysis
            of 214 independent samples (N = 60,094) suggested that HPWPs, and to a lesser extent,
            collective education, are antecedents of HCR (ρ = .48 and .17, respectively). In contrast,
            collective work experience is largely unrelated to HCR (ρ = .06). Second, HCR have
            a positive relation with collective outcomes. Corrected correlations between HCR and
            outcomes range from .16 for motivation-based HCR to .36 for knowledge- and skills-based
            HCR. Third, overall HCR is more strongly related to collective performance (ρ = .22)
            than education (ρ = .01) and work experience (ρ = .14). Overall, these findings suggest
            that HCR are not the same as some antecedents of HCR, and that using those antecedents
            to capture HCR underestimates relations between this key resource and collective outcomes.
            Furthermore, HCR are multidimensional and some dimensions (e.g., knowledge and skills)
            appear to be more strongly related to collective performance than other dimensions
            (e.g., personality and motivation).

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Nanocrystals such as semiconducting quantum dots and gold nanoparticles have attracted
            a lot of attentions due to their unique size- and shape- dependent optical properties.
            They have been used in various of biological applications such as sensing, imaging
            and drug delivery. In chapter 1, we provided a brief introduction about the optical
            properties of nanoparticles and why they are attractive. We also discuss several studies
            reported to prepare nanoparticle dispersions in aqueous media. In Chapter 2, we presented
            a routine about how we studied the stoichiometry of the organic ligand shell on hydrophobic
            CdSe-ZnS QDs. Combining a few advanced solution phase NMR spectroscopy techniques,
            we were able to monitor the purification process and study the affinity of surface
            ligands. Other measurements were used to complement the results obtained from NMR
            spectroscopy, namely matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and FTIR.
            In Chapter 3, we extended this work to hydrophilic CdSe-ZnS core-shell quantum dots
            and Au nanoparticles where is more widely used in biological application. We chose
            three lipoic acid based polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified ligands with different
            number of PEG chains or different number of anchoring group to study the effect of
            surface ligand architecture to the surface coverage. Free ligands in the buffer media
            and bound ligands on the nanoparticle surface were distinguished using diffusion ordered
            spectroscopy. Quantitative study was conducted to determine the ligand density. Factors
            that affect the surface coverage were discussed. In Chapter 4, we explored another
            important feature of nanoparticles - hydrodynamic size, a characteristic dimension
            that reflects the Brownian motion of objects, such as proteins, macromolecules and
            nanoparticles when dispersed (or homogeneously suspended) in any fluid phase. Both
            Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) were used to extract
            the size information. The results were compared size by size. The similarity and differences
            of two techniques were discussed in details. In Chapter 5, we summarized the idea
            and contributions assembled in this dissertation followed by a discussion of the future
            outlook.

         <p><span class="label">ABSTRACT: </span>Organic metal halide hybrids have recently emerged as a highly promising class of
            functional materials for a variety of optoelectronic applications. The exceptional
            structural tunability has been demonstrated for this class of materials with different
            types of crystallographic structures. Using appropriate organic moieties and metal
            halide salts, organic metal halide hybrids with three- (3D), two- (2D), one- (1D),
            and zero-dimensional (0D) structures at the molecular level have been developed and
            studied. Despite the remarkable progress realized in the 3D and 2D metal halide structures,
            1D and 0D structures with unique properties were left significantly underexplored.
            Lowering the dimensionality to 0D with the individual polyhedral metal halides separated
            from each other allows the bulk crystals to exhibit intrinsic properties (e.g. efficient
            Stokes-shifted broadband emissions) of their building blocks, which is significantly
            different from their counterparts with higher dimensionalities. We have demonstrated
            the capability to synthetically control the photophysical properties of this class
            of 0D hybrids by different strategies, such as tuning of their compositions, metal
            halide geometries, and molecular environments. The excitement about the recent developments
            lies not only in the specific achievements but also in what these materials represent
            in terms of a new paradigm in materials design. The application of low dimensional
            hybrids as single-component phosphor in optically pumped white LEDs will also be discussed.
